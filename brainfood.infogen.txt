“ I know one thing: that I know nothing.” - Socrates
====
Struggle Is Good. Never say “I can’t take it anymore.” Say “Bring it on!”
====
Learn Every Day. You’ve got to train your brain to stay alert. You don’t have to read a book a day to learn every day. Learn from your mistakes. Learn from the people around you — be open to what they can teach you.
====
Money Is Not The Most Important Thing. You have to train yourself not to care about money and focus on providing value instead. Also, don’t become too dependent on the stuff you own — otherwise, the stuff will own you.
====
Be Nice. I don’t mean you should be a pushover. You can be someone that doesn’t take shit and be nice about it. Just don’t insult people, think you’re better than them, or act like an idiot.
====
Think About Others. Just be mindful, that’s all. We all have families, bills to pay, and our own issues. Don’t always make everything about yourself.
====
Don’t Complain. Complaining is the biggest waste of time there is. Either do something about it, and if you can’t, shut up about it.
====
Don’t Judge. Just because people make different choices than you, they are not stupid. Also, you don’t know everything about people, so don’t judge them. Help them.
====
Give Without Expecting Something In Return. Don’t keep score. You will become a bitter person if you do that. Give solely for the joy of giving. If you get something in return, great, if you don’t, great.
====
Don’t Take Yourself So Seriously. Yeah, yeah, you’re an individual, and people have to take you seriously, I get it. But at the end of the day, we’re all a bunch of ants trying to chase the same things. Lighten up.
====
Never Look Back Too Long. Reflecting on the past is only good for one thing: Learning.
====
Take Action. Don’t just sit there, do something. Without action, there is no outcome.
====
Enjoy Small Things. I like clichés because they are true. Especially this one. You know why? Everyone says they know it, but no one lives up to it. They just chase big things.
====
"Life’s a roller coaster you don’t always get to choose the seat you’re in, but you can choose to throw your hands up and enjoy the ride." - Anonymous
====
“Pain is the universe’s way of demanding that you continue to learn. The more pain you can tolerate, the more you can learn.” - Phil Stutz and Barry Michels 
====
The goal of life is to be excited to go to work and to be excited to come back home. - Joshua Kushner
====
Everyone searches for opportunities while running from problems, missing that they're the same thing. Problems aren't obstacles to opportunity, they ARE the opportunity.
====
It doesn’t matter what position you find yourself in right now. What matters is whether you improve your position today. Every ordinary moment is an opportunity to make the future easier or harder.
====
"Now is the accepted time, not tomorrow, not some more convenient season. It is today that our best work can be done." - W.E.B. Du Bois
====
Don’t be afraid of anyone. If you can imagine: living your life, you’re not afraid of anyone. - Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed rules for living
====
If you don’t commit to living life on your terms, other people will commit you to theirs.
====
You get a really good bullshit detector, and you learn how to use it. You know, just: “Is that really happening or not?” - Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed rules for living
====
Bullshit can be a greater enemy of the truth than lies. - Harry Frankfurt
====
The real problem of humanity is… paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. - Edward O. Wilson
====
Be really, really tender. - Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed rules for living
====
You have to train before the race, not after. You have to build the skill before you get the job that requires it. You have to be trustworthy for years before anyone trusts you with something important. The bill comes first. The reward comes later.
====
“Be loose! Make it vague. Because there are so many forces that are there to push you in certain directions, and they’re traps. Especially when it comes to defining yourself as an artist" - Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed rules for living
====
The person who focuses on fewer things goes further than the person distracted by many.
====
Surround yourself with people who are thoughtful in ways you are not, because they see what you can't.
====
Convince yourself and others to forgo instant gratification, often through strategic distraction.
====
You don't need more time; you need more focus. Fewer projects. Fewer commitments. Fewer obligations. Fewer responsibilities. Carefully choose your commitments, then go all in. Time isn't the constraint. Your choices are. Great outcomes aren't built on great days, but on consistent ones.
You can't just count the days when it's easy. Each day moves you closer to the goal. No day is a hero; no day is a villain.
Perfect days don't compound. Consistent ones do.
====
Short-term results come from intensity. Long-term results come from consistency.
====
Ninety percent of success can be boiled down to consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are.
====
Working smart isn't the opposite of working hard. It's the result of working hard.
You have to put in the hours before you can see the shortcuts. You have to learn the details before you can know which ones matter.
You have to do the work wrong many times before you discover how to do it right.
====
Your capacity for excellence is inversely proportional to the number of your commitments.
====
Your choices determine your trajectory.
====
Make your mood, or it makes you.
====
"Life is like a trumpet. If you don't put anything into it, you don't get anything out." - WC Handy
====
When your primary goal is to be liked, you can't take risks. You can't disagree. You can't push boundaries. You become a prisoner of other people's expectations.
====
"The secret to happiness, of course, is not getting what you want; it's wanting what you get." - Alex Trebek
====
“I think and think and think, I've thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.” - Jonathan Safran Foer
====
"My life has been a quest for knowledge and understanding, and I am nowhere near having achieved that. And it doesn't bother me in the least." - Alex Trebek
====
★ Abundance reduces appreciation. By deliberately limiting access to the things we enjoy — whether lattes or luxury cars — we can maintain their specialness and maximize pleasure. Small pleasures deliver more happiness when they're occasional treats rather than everyday occurrences.
====
★ “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.” - John Gall
====
The person who finishes one race beats the person who starts a hundred and never finishes.
====
Life comes down to two things:
1. Knowing how to get what you want
2. Knowing what’s worth wanting
====
Going all in on something for a month gets better results than dabbling in it for a decade. The dabbler spreads their energy over many things. The focused person concentrates their effort on one. The most dangerous competitor is the one with a single goal.
====
“Every human being is dealt a different hand in life and you can’t control the cards that someone else is holding. The more time you spend staring at someone else, the more you miss the entire point of the game.”
====
“You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency.
Intensity impresses; consistency transforms.”
====
Short-term results come from intensity.
Long-term results come from consistency.
====
Two rules to help you be consistent with exercise this year:
1. Show up.
2. You can quit tomorrow.
Repeat.
====
Telling yourself you'll do it tomorrow is how dreams die.
====
"What to do with a mistake: recognize it, admit it, learn from it, forget it." - Dean Smith
====
When you truly understand something, you can express it at any level of detail while maintaining coherence.
The master can provide the one-sentence version, the paragraph version, and the chapter version, all of which tell the same story at different resolutions. The novice can only repeat what they've memorized at one resolution.
====
Don't let your worst moments become your story.
You blow the presentation and spend the drive home scripting perfect comebacks to an audience that's already gone. Your relationship ends and you spend months replaying conversations that can't be changed. All the time spent perfecting the past is stolen from the future that's still waiting.
The past is a teacher, not a judge. Your next move matters more than your last mistake.
====
"One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world." - Malala Yousafzai
====
Progress is just falling and getting back up over and over again, disguised as a straight line.
====
What you're taught isn’t always what matters.
====
"Celebrate what you've accomplished, but raise the bar a little higher each time you succeed." - Mia Hamm
====
Stick to the basics:
Be reliable.
Do your job.
Speak for yourself.
Outcome over ego.
Focus on the details.
See challenges as opportunities.
Go to bed smarter than when you woke up.
====
Reliability is magnetic because humans are hardwired to avoid risk, so once you prove yourself trustworthy and reliable, you become the default choice for opportunities without ever asking for them.
====
Most arguments are ego competitions disguised as truth-seeking.
Learning to say "you're probably right" will save you a lot of time and energy.
====
"Voices ought not be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth." - Sam Cooke
====
Swim in your lane.
Every second you spend looking at a person in another lane comes at the cost of your progress.
Focus on yourself.
====
All the time you spend worrying about the opportunities you don't have comes at the expense of maximizing the opportunities you do have.
====
"The waiting of pleasure is a pleasure itself" - Gotthold Ephraim Lessing
====
Progress only comes from changing how you see the world.
====
Things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could. - Rudiger Dornbusch
====
Anyone can move fast. That's the trap. Speed is cheap, but the ability to be fast without being reckless is expensive.
The chess master's lightning moves come from decades of slow study. The CEO who is in the weeds knows where the problems lurk.
Details don't slow you down; they speed you up.
====
"All of us invent ourselves. Some of us just have more imagination than others." - Cherilyn "Cher" Sarkisian
====
The clearer you are about your priorities, the easier it is to say no.
When your priorities are clear, every 'no' becomes a step toward what matters.
====
Your calendar is the most honest autobiography you'll ever write. It doesn't matter what you say your priorities are; your calendar reveals the truth. Each block is a decision about what matters, stripped of pretense and rationalization. Your calendar isn't just recording your time—it's exposing your lies.
====
When you consistently read biographies, something interesting happens. Life keeps throwing the same situations at you that you've read about in books. Only now you've seen what worked and what didn't.
Reading gives you pattern recognition for problems you haven't faced yet.
Having someone who solved the same problem you're facing whispering the answer in your ear is basically a cheat code.
====
In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are only as good as your consistency.
====
Consistency compounds while occasional brilliance fades.
====
When you're only halfway interested in something, you'll lose to someone obsessed. It won't even be close. It's worth asking why.
Small advantages compound over time like interest in a bank account, so being 10% more committed doesn't give you 10% better results; it gives you 10x better results. Think of it like studying: the genuinely curious person will remember and connect ideas in ways that the person just trying to pass will never.
Being all in doesn't just beat partially in; it crushes it.
====
There are a lot of things you don't control.

You don't get to pick your parents.
You don't get to pick the country you are born in.
You don't get to pick your given talent.
You don't get to pick the test.

You don't control where you start, but you can change where you go.
Integrity is a choice.
Kindness is a choice.
Hard work is a choice.
Preparation is a choice.
Consistency is a choice.
Your attitude is a choice.
Your response is a choice.
The people you hang around are a choice.
Changing your trajectory is a choice.
====
"Change, although it involves risks, is the law of life." - Robert Kennedy
====
Your heroes are your blueprints.
Study what makes them exceptional, not to become them but to become who you're capable of being. The point isn't to be a second-rate version of your hero, it's to be a first-rate version of yourself with upgraded tools.
Learn their system. Keep your soul.

“Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.”
- John Kenneth Galbraith
====
"Do the best you can in every task, no matter how unimportant it may seem at the time." - Sandra Day O'Connor
====
“I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands.” - Sherlock Holmes
====
The most selfish act of all is kindness, because it's payback is so much greater than the investment. - Tom Peters
====
The illiterate of the 21st century will be those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. - Alvin Toffler
====
“We want the outcome, but we need the journey.
Falling in love with outcomes doesn't move you forward. Falling in love with the process does.”
====
The greats don't wait. Every major innovation started with someone doing something small. YouTube began with a few friends posting grainy videos. Amazon started by selling books from a garage. Google began as a grad school project. What separates dreamers from doers isn't talent or luck, it's the willingness to start before feeling ready. The perfect moment is a myth. The right time is now.
But here's the key: Start small and learn fast. Your first move doesn't need to be perfect; it just needs to teach you something. Focus more on the next small step that moves you closer to the goal.
Motion creates momentum, and momentum reveals opportunities that standing still never could.
====
A focused hour outweighs an unfocused day.

"Once you learn to read, you will be forever free." - Frederick Douglass
====
“Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer.” 
To pay attention, “our thought must be empty, waiting, not seeking anything.” We must be open to “suspending” it, “leaving it detached, empty and ready to be penetrated by the object.” Paying attention means transcending the inner chatter, releasing expectations, and opening ourselves to anything and everything the thing we’re attending to has to offer. - Simone Weil
====
Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring. Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new, marvelous, intoxicating. - Simone Weil
====
Your Attention Requires Three Forms of Light
Spotlight attention: Focuses on immediate tasks and short-term actions (making coffee, finding glasses, reading a chapter). When disrupted, you can't complete these immediate tasks.
Starlight attention: Directs your longer-term projects and goals (writing a book, building a business, being a good parent). Like stars guiding travelers, it keeps you oriented toward your bigger objectives. When disrupted, you lose sight of where you're heading.
Daylight attention: Enables self-reflection and clarity about what you truly want. It helps you understand why you chose your long-term goals and who you want to be. When this attention is disrupted, you may lose touch with your core identity and purpose. - Johann Hari
====
The greatest business failures often come not from playing the game poorly, but from continuing to excel at things that no longer matter.
====
"Your failures are your accomplishments because it makes you prepared for whatever it is that you are going to do next." - Lee Daniels
====
Multi-Tasking is a Myth
The human brain can only hold one or two conscious thoughts at a time - this is a fixed biological limit of our neural hardware. Yet we've convinced ourselves we can think about many things simultaneously. This is simply a myth we created rather than accepting our natural cognitive constraints. - Johann Hari
====
To achieve a flow state, you must dedicate yourself to a single task - no multitasking, no distractions. Mihaly's research shows that flow demands your complete mental focus on one activity. Since our brain can only truly process one or two things consciously, flow emerges when we align with this natural limitation and direct all our cognitive resources toward a single purpose. - Johann Hari
====
Sleep deprivation directly damages our ability to focus and maintain attention. Among the first cognitive functions to deteriorate when we lack sleep is our attention span. Research shows that as tiredness increases, people struggle with basic tasks like following conversations or playing simple games. Each hour of missed sleep progressively erodes our capacity to concentrate and process information effectively. - Johann Hari
====
The most valuable skill isn't inspiration but the ability to work without it.

Discipline is cheaper than regret.

The loudest signals come from the emptiest sources. Those who truly possess something rarely need to announce it.
====
"Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace." - Amelia Earhart
====
"Ours is the commencement of a flying age, and I am happy to have popped into existence at a period so interesting." - Amelia Earhart
====
The courage to start.
The discipline to focus.
The confidence to figure it out.
The patience to know progress is not always visible.
The persistence to keep going, even on the bad days.
====
“The patience you need for big things, is developed by your patience with the little things.” - Kevin Kelly
====
"Self-development is a higher duty than self-sacrifice." - Elizabeth Cady Stanton
====
"Respect your efforts, respect yourself. Self-respect leads to self-discipline. When you have both firmly under your belt, that's real power." - Clint Eastwood
====
Persistence isn't just continuing to try
it's the runway that gives your talent time to take off.
====
“'I don’t have enough time' is not a useful phrase when it comes to anything related to your dream. It’s okay to actively choose to do something or not, but don’t blame time.” - Alexi Pappas
====
Every choice is a brushstroke. No single stroke creates a masterpiece, but eventually the portrait emerges.
====
Motivation has perfect attendance. It always shows up after you.
====
“It can be hard to appreciate just how much the world will give you what you want after you stop waiting for it to give you what you deserve.
Stop waiting for the world to recognize your potential; start giving the world something positive. Don't wait for a friend's apology; reach out and reconnect. Instead of waiting for the perfect partner, become that partner. Rather than waiting for motivation to exercise, start small and build momentum. Don't complain about something; change it.
Life rewards action.”
====
The most powerful productivity tool ever invented is simply the word "no."
====
The single most effective habit is the willingness to change your own mind.
If you want to understand someone, figure out the narrative they tell themselves about themself.
If you want to change your behavior, change your narrative. If you want to change someone else’s behavior, offer them a more compelling narrative they can tell themselves.
====
“The beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread, but every time we repeat the act, we strengthen the strand, add to it another filament, until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably in thought and act.” - Orison Swett Marden
====
"Change, by its very nature, is threatening but it is also often productive." - Betty Ford
====
“Lessons are repeated until they are learned. A lesson will be presented to you in various forms until you have learned it. When you have learned it, you can go on to the next lesson.” - Cherie Carter-Scott
====
“Think of these levels as reading to entertain, reading to inform, reading to understand, and reading to master. When you learned to read in elementary school, you were taught to read for entertainment. If you made it to high school and college, you learned to read to inform. This is where most people stop. But most of the value comes at the last two levels.”
====
“There is only one way to read, which is to browse in libraries and bookshops, picking up books that attract you, reading only those, dropping them when they bore you, skipping the parts that drag – and never, never reading anything because you feel you ought, or because it is part of a trend or a movement. Remember that the book which bores you when you are twenty or thirty will open doors for you when you are forty or fifty-and vise versa. Don’t read a book out of its right time for you.” - Doris Lessing 
====
“If a book is tedious to you, don’t read it; that book was not written for you.” - Jorge Luis Borges
====
Competence is often less of a problem than confidence.
An underrated aspect of doing anything hard is believing in yourself. Action creates both confidence and momentum.
When action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on.
A marathoner who hits a wall running at mile 5 doesn't focus on the end of the race; they focus on getting around the next corner. Then, the next corner.
What's the smallest step you can take right now to make progress?
====
“You’re only as good as you’re willing to be bad…The fact that you’re not going to be good at something or that you’re going to fail at something—that’s OK. Because you’re never going to get good unless you’re willing to be bad.” - Randall Stutman
====
Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It’s not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity.
====
"A vision gives a purpose to daily pursuits. A reason to push yourself out of bed each morning and do something. Without this purpose, it's easy to drift." - Bob Bowman, Michael Phelps' coach
====
"Purpose is an essential element of you ... the struggles along the way are only meant to shape you for your purpose." - Chadwick Boseman
====
“There was something heavy in me. … I wasn’t doing the right thing. I was just trying to copy exactly everything I had learned. And I think that happens in every craft in life. You’re young. You have a master. You want to emulate them, do what they do. But at some point in life, you have to turn around and say I have to find my own way in my own language.” - Chef Francis Mallmann
====
“[I]t is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.” - William Clifford
====
"Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see" - commonly misattributed to Edgar Allan Poe, 
====
It is more accurate to think of belief as probabilistic. There are probably contexts where you already do this, but some where it is much less common.
====
“I believe the way toward mastery of any endeavor is to work toward simplicity; replace complex technology with knowledge. The more you know, the less you need. From my feeble attempts at simplifying my own life I’ve learned enough to know that should we have to, or choose to, live more simply, it won’t be an impoverished life but one richer in all the ways that really matter.” - Yvon Chouinard

Strength isn't measured by victories, but by the caliber of challenges you're willing to face.

"We need to redefine "problems" into opportunities.
Problems are an opportunity to create value.
Problems are an opportunity to strengthen relationships.
Problems are an opportunity to differentiate yourself from others.
Every problem is an opportunity in disguise."

“Effort requires no talent. Hustle requires no talent.” - Marshall Faulk
====
"Talent and potential mean nothing if you can't consistently do things when you don't feel like doing them."

The best things in life, trust, talent, luck, have one thing in common: the harder you chase them, the faster they run.
Your reputation is the only magnet strong enough to make them come to you.
====
Luck writes the first chapter, but your actions write the rest.
====
One more rep.
One more step.
One more minute.
One more revision.
One more practice test.

It's so easy to stop, but most of the value comes from one more.
====
"Practice, which some regard as a chore, should be approached as just about the most pleasant recreation ever devised." - Babe Didrikson Zaharias
====
"Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are." - John Wooden
====
"Skills can be taught. Character you either have or you don’t have." - Anthony Bourdain
====
Most people wait for permission to solve problems. The subtle message they send is "I don't care enough to solve this on my own. Tell me what to do." The world happens to them.
High agency people are different. They care. And because they care, they solve problems without being told. They happen to the world.
High agency people act like owners. Owners see a problem and fix it. They don't wait. They don't need permission. They don't think this is someone else's job. They don't think this is hard. They don't think "I can't do this, I've never done it before." They don't think this is someone else's job.
Act like an owner before you are one. That's how you become one.
====
Your reputation isn’t what you shout, it’s what people whisper.
====
Stop trying to be spectacular. Start being consistent. Your reputation isn't built on your best day. It's built on your worst. Warren Buffett's fortune was built on avoiding losses. Tom Brady became the GOAT not because of his highlight-reel throws, but because he rarely made a bad play.
Anyone can occasionally go to the gym, eat a healthy meal, and have a productive day. Doing it once in a while is common and doesn't mean much.
Moments don't make legends. Consistency does. And the hardest consistency isn't in doing brilliant things but avoiding stupid ones. Every mistake puts you in hard mode, forcing you to make up lost ground.
Anyone can do it once. The outliers do it often.
====
"The minute you start talking about what you're going to do if you lose, you have lost." - George Shultz
====
Your mistakes aren’t the best teacher—just the most expensive.
You can start at the bottom of the mountain and make every mistake from scratch on the way to the top, or you can take a sherpa with you and master the best of what other people have already figured out.
The successful learn vicariously; the foolish insist on firsthand pain.
====
The people who get the most done don't agonize over decisions. It's not because they have better judgment. They've just structured their lives so being wrong isn't expensive.
When mistakes are cheap, you can move fast and fix what doesn't work. When mistakes are expensive, you overthink everything and still choose wrong.
This is why startups can run circles around big companies. It's not because they're smarter, but because being wrong isn't expensive.
====
“There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge.” - Napoleon Hill
====
Someone always has an advantage. If you don’t know who, it isn’t you.
====
Stop fighting your nature. Start winning with it. You're born with certain core traits. Fighting them is like being a sprinter forced to run marathons – exhausting and futile. But these "limitations" can become your biggest advantage. Your instincts, personality, and preferences aren't flaws - they're features. When something seems to be holding you back that you can't change, the key is to change your environment. What's a headwind in one situation is a tailwind in another. The most successful people don't fight their nature. They architect their environment to amplify it. Stop asking: "How do I fix myself?" Start asking: "How do I position myself where my natural traits are assets?"

I think it's generally human nature to over-estimate risk and under-estimate opportunity. ... The risks are probably not as big as you perceive and the opportunities may be bigger than you percieve. - Jeff Bezos

"Whoever is not in the possession of leisure can hardly be said to possess independence." - Herman Melville

“The anditode to doom is curiosity.” - Ezra Klein

What you find interesting is a better predictor of success than what you're good at.
Curiosity isn't random; it's a compass.

"In my experience, each failure contains the seeds of your next success—if you are willing to learn from it." - Paul Allen
====
“I have spoken of the necessity of being frank and honest with oneself about one's own affairs: many people assume that they can get away from the truth by avoiding thinking about it, but the natural law is inevitable, and the sooner it is recognized, the better.” - John D. Rockefeller
====
"I do not think that there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything, even nature." - John D. Rockefeller
====
When you fall in love with the process rather than the outcome, you don't have to wait to be happy.
====
When you're impatient with results, every day feels expensive. When you're impatient with effort, every day feels like progress.
====
The problem with success is that it teaches you the wrong lessons. What worked yesterday becomes religion, and religions don't adapt.
====
"Three secrets to success: Be willing to learn new things. Be able to assimilate new information quickly. Be able to get along with and work with other people." - Sally Ride
====
Success has a way of attracting people who disappear in storms.
====
People think good decision-making is about being right all the time. It's not. It's about lowering the cost of being wrong and changing your mind.
When the cost of mistakes is high, we're paralyzed with fear. When the cost of mistakes is low, we can move fast and adapt.
Make mistakes cheap, not rare.
====
Work becomes great when curiosity drives it beyond obligation.
====
Problems scream for attention while successes only whisper. We're wired to chase whatever's loudest.
Your biggest opportunity isn't hiding in what's broken; it's hiding in what's working that you've stopped noticing.

When we lack real problems, we create imaginary ones; when we lack meaningful work, we perfect the unimportant.

science - Use the Baloney Detection Kit
“In the course of their training, scientists are equipped with a baloney detection kit. The kit is brought out as a matter of course whenever new ideas are offered for consideration. If the new idea survives examination by the tools in our kit, we grant it warm, although tentative, acceptance. If you're so inclined, if you don't want to buy baloney even when it's reassuring to do so, there are precautions that can be taken; there's a tried-and-true, consumer-tested method.
“What's in the kit? Tools for skeptical thinking. - Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World

Question Authority
"One of the great commandments of science is, 'Mistrust arguments from authority.’ (Scientists, being primates, and thus given to dominance hierarchies, of course do not always follow this commandment.) Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else. This independence of science, its occasional unwillingness to accept conventional wisdom, makes it dangerous to doctrines less self-critical, or with pretensions to certitude. - Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World
====
Borrowed wisdom breaks under pressure because you haven't earned it.
You're trusting someone else's compression without knowing what created it.
Earned wisdom, on the other hand, holds up because it's rooted in your actual experience. You know when it works, why it works, when to ignore it and when to bend it because you created the compression.

Test Your Hypotheses
The reliance on carefully designed and controlled experiments is key. We will not learn much from mere contemplation. It is tempting to rest content with the first candidate explanation we can think of. One is much better than none. But what happens if we can invent several?" - Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World
====
Maintain Wonder While Being Skeptical
"At the heart of science is a balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes - an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive, and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense." - Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World

“There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your own way.” - Christopher Morley

A lot of success in life is just putting yourself in a position for good things to happen to you.

+ Be reliable
+ Avoid drama
+ Help other people win
+ Take care of your body
+ Take care of your mind
+ Live below your means
+ Treat your job as if it matters
+ Take care of your relationships

Simple, but not easy.

I remember once I called Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, about some little success I’d had on some project. He was very busy and frustrated that I’d interrupted, but politely, he said, “Ryan, you are calling me to tell me that you did your job.” I thought of that conversation when I saw that famous scene in Mad Men where Peggy complains that Don never says thank you. “That’s what the money is for!” he tells her. - Ryan Holiday

Compensation follows autonomy.
When you need to be managed, there's a cap on what you can earn. When you know how to create value and do it without being told, there's no cap. This is structural, not personal.
The compensation gap isn't about performance; it's about autonomy.

The thing that’s wrong about imposter syndrome is that for the most part no one is thinking about you at all. They’re too busy with their own doubts and their own work.

Find canvases for other people to paint on. Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up and comers to introduce them to. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiency and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.

So it had never occurred to me there were people doing it who weren't trying to make the best film that ever was. Why would you otherwise? Even if it's not going to be the best film that's ever been made, you have to believe that it could be. You just pour yourself into it and when it affects someone that way, that is a huge thrill for me—huge thrill. I feel like I have managed to wrap them the up in it way I try to wrap myself up.” - Christopher Nolan

When I was 20 years old, I was working at this talent agency in Hollywood, and I got invited to this important meeting. As they were talking about stuff, I interjected and said something. My mentor took me aside after and he said, why did you say that? Did you think it actually needed to be said or did you just feel like you wanted to have something to say? I think about that all the time. It’s in The 48 Laws of Power - Always say less than necessary. Saying less than necessary, not interjecting at every chance we get—this is actually the mark not just of a self-disciplined person, but also a very smart and wise person.

When I first moved to Austin in 2013, I went out to lunch—fittingly—with a writer named Austin Kleon. I was a longtime fan of his book Steal Like an Artist (his book Keep Going is another favorite). After we ate, he drove me around the city, showing me things and giving me advice. Austin was a little older than me and already married with kids. I remember asking him how he made time for it all. “I don’t,” he told me. “Life is about tradeoffs.” And then he gave me a little rule that has stuck with me always: Work, family, scene. Pick two. Your creative output, your personal relationships, and your social life—balancing all three is impossible. You can excel in two if you say no to one. If you can’t, you’ll have none.

Robert Greene’s metaphor for mastery is being on the inside of something. When we start a new sport, when we get our first job, when we approach a field we haven’t yet studied, we are on the outside of. But as we put in the work, as we familiarize ourselves with every component, as we develop our intuitive field, we eventually make our way to the inside. This is a metaphor from Robert I think about constantly. I don’t want to be an outsider on anything I do, I want to make my way inside it.

In 2013, I started a business with a partner that my wife warned me against working with. I remember explaining to her why she was wrong and that I couldn’t possibly not do this because of some vague gut instinct of hers. The business turned into a nightmare, and it turned out that this partner was not someone I should have worked with. This shares a commonality with almost all my mistakes and regrets: Not listening to my wife from the beginning. You have to learn whose judgment to trust. You have to learn who knows you better than you know yourself, and you have to be able to trust and defer to them.
====
The trope that a day job takes away from your art or your hustle is stupid. There was a great exhibition at the Blanton Museum a couple years ago about artists who had day jobs. I wrote 3.5 books while I was the Director of Marketing at American Apparel. I started my own marketing company while I was a writer. I have my bookstore. A job for someone coming up is like a trust fund you’ve earned. It helps.
====
Learning is priceless. Robert Greene used to have to nag me to submit my hours when I worked for him. To me, the money was an afterthought, I knew the real return was my access to him, that he would answer my questions, that I could see how a real pro did the job.
====
My career in Hollywood came to an end when one of the talent managers took a dislike to me (I told this story at the beginning of my appearance on Joe Rogan). When I ended up at American Apparel, I asked Robert Greene about how to prevent that from happening. He pointed out my problem before was that I had only had one ally or patron. I needed to cultivate relationships with multiple decision makers/power brokers at the new company, especially a place as political and full of intrigue as American Apparel. So that’s what I did–you don’t want to be dependent on a single thread or a single vote of confidence. You need redundancies. You need relationships.

Nothing is permanent. Some things are just renewed faster than they decay.
We want the naturally perfect relationship, but the ones that endure are renewed each morning.

"Nobody wants to believe happiness is a choice, because that puts responsibility in their hands. It’s the same reason people self-pity: to delay action, to make an outcry to the universe, as though the more they state how bad things are, the more likely it is that someone else will change them." - Brianna Wiest
====
“People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or the power to seek and find.” - Thomas Mitchell
====
The hardest truth about happiness is that it's a choice.
Watch how people discuss their problems. They'll spend hours explaining why things are terrible, how unfair life is, and how others need to change. But suggest they might have the power to improve things and they suddenly have countless reasons why that's impossible. Self-pity feels safer than responsibility.

“When we learn to do anything new - how to drive, for example - we go through three stages. The first stage demands a lot of attention as we try out the controls, learn the rules of driving, and so on. In the second stage we begin to coordinate our knowledge, linking movements together and more fluidly combining our actions with our knowledge of the car, the situation, and the rules. In the third stage we drive the car with barely a thought. It’s automatic. And with that our improvement at driving slows dramatically, eventually stopping completely.” - Geoff Colvin

What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days. Anyone can nourish their most important relationships when life is smooth, but the effort you put in during the rough patches matters more. When you're motivated, eating healthy is easy, but your choices on your toughest days can undo your progress. Keeping your emotions in check is easy when things are going well, but managing your emotions when the world isn't cooperating sets you apart. Push through the grind and maintain the momentum.

"It's those who lie outside ordinary experience who have the most to teach us." - Malcolm Gladwell
====
One big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions – that is such a key phrase – all emotions are useful. - David Robson
====
We do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term. - David Robson
====
It is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards. - David Robson

To change our responses to difficult feelings listen to music. "Shifters", are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life. - David Robson

When you know what's coming, prepare. When you don't know what's coming, position.

If you have a presentation on the calendar next week, you can rehearse. If you have an appointment, you can easily factor in travel time so you're not late. If you know the bill is due next year, you can save the money this year.

When the future is uncertain, you can position. No one knows what's going to happen with the economy, but you can position yourself against potential loss by spending less than you earn. You don't know what's going to happen to your health, but you can strengthen your position against disease by exercising. You don't know when you might need your friends, but you can be in a good position to ask for their help by being the kind of friend they can count on.

Being well-positioned enables anyone to come out ahead no matter what obstacles the unknown may present.

Most complexity is unnecessary, but we manage it instead of removing it because deletion requires courage that addition doesn't.

Complexity increases because adding is easy and removing is dangerous.
Whenever there's a problem, we add: a new person, requirement, or process. We never subtract.
Why? Because everything that already exists has a champion. That clause in the tax code, that step in the process, that feature in the product ... someone fought for it, and they'll fight you if you try to remove it.
So we become professional complexity managers. Entire careers are built managing unnecessary mass. But this is the opportunity. While everyone else adds mass to the system, removing it creates an unfair advantage. The lighter you are, the faster you move.
Removing what shouldn't exist creates more value than any addition could.

We avoid doing simple things that work because they don't make us look smart.
Smart people feel stupid doing simple things, so we invent complicated alternatives that accomplish less but feel more intellectually satisfying.

1. Bloom’s taxonomy of learning
When studying a topic, it may be hard to define our learning objectives. Bloom’s taxonomy is Bloom’s taxonomy is a set of three lists used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists focus respectively on learning objectives in the cognitive domain (knowledge-based), affective (emotion-based) and psychomotor domains (action-based).
- Knowledge-based objectives. The six levels of the cognitive domain are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. 
- Emotion-based objectives. There are five levels in the affective domain, which measures how much you care about what you are studying: passive attention (the lowest level), active participation, valuation, organisation, and characterisation
- Action-based objectives. Finally, the psychomotor domain measures your ability to actually manipulate relevant tools. The skills in the psychomotor domain include: perception (where you sense the need for a tool), readiness to act, guided response (where you can reproduce someone’s use of a tool), mechanism (where the use of the tool becomes natural), and complex overt response (where you can alter existing tools or even build your own tools).

- Deferral of judgment
- Off-beat ideas
- Vast quantities of ideas
- Elaboration/expansion of ideas

Darryn Kruse, a campus principal and teacher, created a slightly different version, the ROPE method of brainstorming:
- Record all ideas
- Original ideas are encouraged (no stupid ideas)
- Put off evaluation (judgement can be done later)
- Expand on other’s ideas

Five Whys
Five Whys is an iterative interrogative technique. By repeating the question “why?” five times in a row, the technique is used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem, with the primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a problem.

Here is an example of using the Five Whys technique, where a project wasn’t launched on time:

Why wasn’t the project launched on time? Because there was a missing piece.
Why was there a missing piece? Because the team didn’t know how to implement it.
Why didn’t the team know how to implement it? Because they didn’t know how to.
Why didn’t they know how to? Because they were not properly trained.
Why weren’t they properly trained? Because no training is offered for this particular piece.
Root problem: the project wasn’t launched on time because there is currently no team training provided to implement a critical piece.

Think-Pair-Share
Think-Pair-Share is a simple collaborative thinking tool to use with a thinking buddy to debug a problem together, then share back what you found with the team.

Think: each person separately thinks about the problem and writes down their thoughts.
Pair: consolidate individual thoughts together.
Share: share back with the rest of the team.

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.
Cultivate the power of your mind:
 “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”
Think high-quality thoughts
 “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
Never let the future disturb you.
 “Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.”
Bear misfortune worthily:
 “Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not ‘This is misfortune,’ but ‘To bear this worthily is good fortune.’”
====
Tell the truth. “I’m going to be honest with you…”. How many times have you heard this phrase or said it yourself? It seems casual or like a way to establish trust. But beginning a remark by claiming we’re going to give it to you straight is of course implying that most of the time we’re not doing that. Honesty should not need a preface, Marcus Aurelius would say. An honest person should be like a smelly goat in the room—you know when they’re there. In matters big or small, public or private, convenient or inconvenient, tell the truth. Don’t be a jerk about it. Don’t give everyone your unsolicited opinion about how they should live or look or act. “Speak the truth as you see it,” Marcus reminded himself, “but with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.” Be honest, not hurtful. Be a bastion of truth in a time of lies. This is more than just the right thing to do, it’s your job. As a friend. As a parent. As an employee. As a human being.
====
"In seeking truth you have to get both sides of a story." - Walter Cronkite
====
Humility not in the idea that you could be wrong, but given how little of the world you’ve experienced you are likely wrong, especially in knowing how other people think and make decisions.
====
"Hatred and anger are the greatest poison to the happiness of a good mind." - Adam Smith
====
Love. In the struggle against injustice, it’s easy to let bitterness and hatred harden your heart. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: “What doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.” When we close ourselves off to love and hope, we naturally experience less love and hope. The Bible reminds us that “whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble.” And James Baldwin, that “hatred…has never failed to destroy the men who hated.” Hatred corrodes. It takes you south, backward, down, down to depths. Love, on the other hand, protects, trusts, hopes, preserves. Love does not fail. It takes you north, it leads you forward. It always wins. Which way are you going? Is your heart growing or shrinking? Is your love and compassion and connection for other people, your hope for a better future, growing or shrinking?

Just be kind. How did Hadrian know that Antoninus would be a worthy mentor to Marcus Aurelius? That he could give his absolute power to another man with only a promise that Antoninus would protect and guide Marcus to one day rule in his place? Because he felt he had glimpsed into Antoninus’ true character when he had once watched Antoninus help his elderly stepfather up a flight of stairs. He didn’t know anyone could see. It wasn’t a performance. It wasn’t ‘virtue signaling’ as we call it today. It was actual virtue—what Antonius brought to his twenty years as Marcus’ guardian and to the Roman people as their leader. Character is fate, the Stoics said. Small acts are no small thing, they said. A helping hand, a smile, a door held open, a favor rendered—you never know who might be watching. You never know what low moment you might be rescuing a person from. You never know the ripple effect your small gesture can have. But that’s not why we do it. We do it because it’s right—because people deserve kindness and because kindness makes us better. We do it because it’s the discipline we practice.

“Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.” - Marcus Aurelius
Gratitude for what you have can cure the endless desire for what you have not.

“How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.” - Marcus Aurelius
Anger is like trying to burn someone else by setting yourself on fire.

“The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.” - Marcus Aurelius
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then differentiation is the sincerest form of insult.

“We love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock in other people’s opinions of us than in our own.” - Marcus Aurelius

“Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead person, see what’s left as a bonus and live it accordingly.” - Marcus Aurelius
We grow so accustomed to life that we forget how miraculous it is. Imagine you were about to die right now, how desperate you’d be to keep living, how much you’d wish you hadn’t taken things for granted. Now embrace life with that same energy.

3. Fredkin's Paradox
The more similar two choices seem, the less the decision should matter, yet the harder it is to choose between them. As a result, we often spend the most time on the decisions that matter least.
To avoid being paralyzed by meaningless choices, use decision-making heuristics.

4. Package-Deal Ethics
“If I can predict all of your beliefs from one of your beliefs, you’re not a serious thinker.” - Chris Williamson
Being pro-choice and pro-gun-control don't logically follow from each other, yet those who believe one usually also believe the other. This is because most people don’t choose beliefs individually but subscribe to “packages” of beliefs offered by a tribe.

7. Fiction Lag (aka Experience-Taking)
When people are captivated by a work of fiction, they unconsciously adopt the traits of their favorite characters. We develop our identities by copying others, and perhaps one reason we enjoy fiction is that it gives us ideas on who to be.

8. Premortem
"Hindsight is 20/20."
Instead of waiting for something to go wrong and then conducting a post-mortem, conduct a “pre-mortem” by imagining it went wrong then using the power of hindsight to deduce the likeliest reason it went wrong.
Imagine you wake up in a hospital. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?
Imagine your partner breaks up with you. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?
Imagine you lose your job. What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?

9. Gambler’s Conceit
People hooked on a risky behavior (e.g. gambling, smoking) reassure themselves they’ll be able to quit while ahead (before bankruptcy, lung cancer). However, their future-self tends to act a lot like them, so if they can't quit now, they likely won't quit later when they’re even deeper in.

Grey Rock Method
Reacting emotionally to narcissists and other toxic people only gives them what they want - your time & energy - which encourages further abuse. If you want to stop receiving provocations, stop being provoked. When the narcissist realizes they can’t manipulate your emotions, they’ll stop trying.

13. Woozle Effect
When a source makes an unproven claim, is then cited as proof by another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the chain of citations looks like evidence. Common because, while many writers check their sources, few check their sources’ sources.
A recent example: evidence that puberty blockers are safe and effective was overestimated because institutions were circularly citing each other:

16. Backwards Law
The more you pursue happiness, the less likely you are to obtain it, because the focus on acquiring it only reinforces the fact that you don’t have it. Ironically, happiness comes easiest to those who don’t worry about it.

18. Longevity Escape Velocity
Technology is gradually improving our lifespans, so if you try to live as long as possible, you may live to see technology that'll allow you to live even longer. Time is the most valuable currency of all, and longevity yields compound interest.
====
19. Roseto Effect
Many long-term studies, including the 50 year Roseto study and the 85 year Harvard Study of Adult Development, found that having close-knit relationships is as important for longevity as diet, sleep, and exercise, yet it’s often neglected by fitness gurus. If you want to live, love.

Anchored-to-your-own-history bias
“Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.” - Morgan Housel
Boomers & Generation X had wildly different experiences of how the economy works, and this gave them different dispositions, worldviews, and political preferences.

Mismatch Theory - Moths evolved to navigate by the moon, a good strategy until the invention of electric lamps, which now lead them astray. Equally, humans evolved to be tribal, a good strategy until the digital age, where it now leads us to act like polarized goons online.

Common Knowledge Effect - Groups are meant to be better decision-makers than individuals, because they combine many perspectives. But in practice, a group doesn't base its decisions on the info specific to each member, but only on the info common to them all. This casts doubt on the idea that “two heads are better than one”, and helps explain why, despite popular wisdom, diversity generally does not make teams better.

Gibson’s Law
“For every PhD there is an equal and opposite PhD.”
Both sides in a court case or policy debate will have support from experts, no matter how crazy the position, because education doesn’t make someone right, it often just makes them more skilled at being wrong.
====
Prospect Theory - People don’t weigh gains and losses evenly. We hate losing money about twice as much as we like gaining it. So, for instance, we’d need to gain $20 to assuage the pain of losing $10. This bias toward loss aversion is one of the foundations of economic behavior.
====
Cached Thoughts - Most of your beliefs were formed earlier in your life, when you were naiver. You continue to believe them only because you’ve never reconsidered them. When you’re about to offer an opinion, consider when you formed it, and ask: is it really your belief, or your younger self’s?

Finality Principle - One day you’ll do something for the last time and never know it. So, whether you’re watching a sunset or arguing with a friend, ask yourself: “What if this was the last time I experience this?” A sense of finality can turn even nuisances into miracles.

Screen technology will cause a crisis of loneliness, especially among young people.
This will lead to widespread depression.
This will also happen at a larger scale. Society will grow more fragmented and disconnected.
Screen technology promises to liberate us, but the reality is that it controls us for the benefit of others.
The people who control the technology work to hide their purposes and goals.
Our survival will depend on our ability to remain independent of these forces.

The layer cake of bad causal reasoning:
#1: a successful person did X, so it works (anecdotal argument)
#2: successful people often do X, so it works (survivorship bias)
#3: successful people do X more often than unsuccessful people, so it works (correlation ≠ causation)
====
Not all correlations mean that one thing causes the other. Some correlations are real but misleading. Others are simply due to chance. Understanding which is which can help you avoid common reasoning errors and make better decisions.
There are five common types of correlations. Only one involves a direct causal link. The others include spurious patterns (flukes), reverse causation, confounding variables, and feedback loops, each with different implications for how we interpret data.
Random patterns can look convincing. The more variables you compare, the more likely it is you’ll find strong but meaningless correlations. This is known as “data dredging,” and it’s a major cause of misinformation in science and media.
Before assuming causality, consider alternatives. Could B be causing A? Could both be caused by C? Could the link be coincidental? By questioning the source of a correlation, you can avoid flawed conclusions and spot more reliable patterns.

Reasoning in public forces discipline of thought.
It's like doing math on the chalkboard in front of the class. Every step must be clear and correct, or someone will point out the mistake. There's no room for fuzzy thinking or skipped steps.
If your reasoning is correct, you have nothing to fear. If it's wrong, you have everything to learn.
====
"If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do. If some one maintains that two and two are five, or that Iceland is on the equator, you feel pity rather than anger, unless you know so little of arithmetic or geography that his opinion shakes your own contrary conviction. The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way."

"Asking for help is a superpower anyone can have but only some people use. It is brave to ask for help. Asking for help is the first step toward finding a mentor. Mentors can help us change our lives if we let them." - Alexi Pappas
====
“We go through life thinking everyone else has it better than us until we grow up and realize we’re all in our own tiny boats of self-doubt and second-guessing.” - Alexi Pappas
====
“Trust your obsessions. This is one I learned more or less accidentally. People sometimes ask whether the research or the idea for the story comes first for me. And I tell them, normally the first thing that turns up is the obsession: for example, all of a sudden I notice that I’m reading nothing but English 17th century metaphysical verse. And I know it’ll show up somewhere—whether I’ll name a character after one of those poets, or use that time period, or use the poetry, I have no idea. But I know one day it’ll be there waiting for me. You don’t always use your obsessions. Sometimes you stick them onto the compost heap in the back of your head, where the rot down, and attach to other things, and get half-forgotten, and will, one day, turn into something completely usable. Go where your obsessions take you. ... Your obsessions may not always take you to commercial places, or apparently commercial places. But trust them.” - Neil Gaiman

The best returns come from your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.
====
There are different types of hard work:
1. Outthinking (a better strategy, a shortcut)
2. Pure Effort (working longer, intensity)
3. Opportunistic (positioning yourself to take advantage of change)
4. Consistency (doing average things for longer)
5. Focus (saying no to distractions)
Each of these requires a different type of hard work.
====
I know what makes people grow more reliably than anything else. It is: taking on a difficult project with some amount of public accountability. This can be large or small: a lecture series, a business, a blog, a house, a child, etc.
====
It’s strange, but I know that it’s common to resist positive emotions, as well as negative ones. Ask yourself, next time you’re doing something enjoyable: are you really surrendering to the full enjoyment available here? The answer will often be no. Perhaps this has something to do with how displays of rapturous delight are often discouraged in adolescence.
====
I’ve worked with hundreds of unhappy creative people, and I can boil down most of my transferable insight into one sentence. I know that it feels horrible to create from a place of defense. For example: you will find it exceedingly difficult to write if your motive is trying to convince people that you are not dumb, or not boring, or if you’re hoping that you will not offend anybody.
====
I know that being silly is a gift. You un-taboo silliness for everyone around you.
====
“Within the first 30 seconds of a conversation, say something encouraging to a person.” - John C. Maxwell, The golden rule of small talk
====
I know that most people overrate the difficulty of hard conversations, and underrate how good it is to have them. Conflict avoidance slowly rots your whole life, and many people are about eight awkward discussions from a much-improved existence. In other words, go squash all of your beefs. This book is a decent start if you have no idea how to do this.
====
I know that hospitality is one domain in which giving is receiving. I’ve regretted spending money on many things, but never food I’ve fed to friends.
====
I know that the people who will make you feel warm and fuzzy when you’re sad, and the people who will give you brutally honest feedback, are usually different people. Ideally you want to have relationships with both kinds, and reward them for their strengths, rather than getting mad at them for failing to do what they’re bad at.
====
“You can’t want somebody’s sobriety or their healing or their financial freedom or their ambition or their happiness more than they do. You will be ready for your loved one to get better, way before they are. Which is why you need to remain in control of your response to the situation. You are not dealing with someone who is capable of rational thought or healthy decision-making.”
====
I know that people really and truly cannot read your mind. It’s easy to think that people are ignoring your wants or emotions because they don’t care about you. But it’s likely that they have no idea what those are. If you’ve told them, they’ve likely forgotten, and may need a reminder - they have their own whole crowded bubble of consciousness going on!
====
I know that travel is valuable because most knowledge can’t be written down. The most crucial info about a society is how it feels to be there—the rhythms of street life, where and when people eat meals, how gender works. You can read a million things about Japan without knowing the bodily experience of walking around in a truly high-trust society, for example.
====
It's never about the outcome. It's always about the day.
====
I know that sometimes, persistence is not a virtue. I would trade my other abilities to be an exceptional songwriter. I gave it a serious enough try to know that I don’t have the knack, for years, and I’m not interested in being publicly mediocre at the performing arts. My life is incalculably better for having let the dream go. The world will be happiest with a certain range of behaviors from you—life will be easier if you find a place in that range where you’re content. David Whyte calls this the conversational nature of reality, and he is correct about the importance of this concept.
====
Energy without imagination is force. Energy with imagination is persistence.
====
I know that talent doesn’t feel like you’re amazing. It feels like the difficulties that trouble others are mysteriously absent in your case. Don’t ask yourself where your true gifts lie. Ask what other people seem weirdly bad at.
====
Those who need reasons to feel good never run out of needs.
====
The people who want to be better welcome honest feedback.
The people who want to stay comfortable fight it.
Let this be a filter.
====
Mandatory work earns you a living. Voluntary work earns you a future.
The work you do during regular hours earns you a paycheck, but it's what you do (or don't do) outside of those hours that earns you opportunity.
I've seen many people fight this insight, and almost none of them win.
====
I know that cabbage is underestimated. Braised cabbage is delicious. Quarter a head of cabbage, sear on all sides in a cast iron pan until slightly blackened, braise with white wine and chicken stock (or this, if you’re vegetarian) until tender, add more butter than seems reasonable, throw some thyme in the pan if you’re fancy, finish with a squeeze of lemon and some Maldon salt. Also, sauerkraut is one of the few foods that will almost always make you feel good.
====
I know that environmental influence is the most effective form of behavioral control. Accordingly, if you want radical change, radically change your environment. Being in the wrong city will cancel out years of self-improvement. 
====
"The environment is where we all meet, where we all have a mutual interest ... It is not only a mirror of ourselves, but a focusing lens on what we can become." - Lady Bird Johnson
====
I know a ridiculous-sounding tip that could make your whole life more satisfying. You might be breathing too high up in your chest. To correct this instantly, pretend you’re breathing through your asshole. 
====
I know how to spot real confidence. Look for people who are fluid with status—who allow themselves to be the butt of a joke, or accept criticism, but also avoid false modesty, and inhabit the spotlight when it falls on them. One might call this a balance between dignity and humility. Pro tip: people who always cling to high status aren’t confident in the normal sense, they are cult leader types, which is a different animal.
====
"The most luxurious possession, the richest treasure anybody has, is his personal dignity." - Jackie Robinson
====
I know that sometimes people unfairly collapse reality via cliche. Your money management issue might be described as a “first world problem,” or your changing desires a “midlife crisis,” by yourself or others. This is a way of dismissing your complexity. 
====
I know that people are too eager to recommend their current lifestyle and disavow their developmentally important previous decisions. For example, you will notice people who had a lot of casual sex when they were young saying later that committed relationships are obviously superior to dating casually—neglecting to notice that their wild young days were psychologically necessary for them.
====
I know that unless you are exceptionally good with ripostes, the best way to win a fight with an angry person on the internet is to not respond. They will look ridiculous fuming impotently on their own.
====
I know that if you’re a man who cringes at the idea of owning your masculinity, you will have a better time if you own your masculinity. 
====
Relatedly, I know that men should give combat sports a try, at least for a short time. For men, fighting is as basic as sex, maybe more basic. If you haven’t acquainted yourself with that part of your nature, there is a fundamental element of your psychology that remains mysterious, and a fundamental human ability you haven’t explored. It’s likely that you are engaging in surrogate combat without realizing it, or suffering from suppressed aggression. Two years of BJJ didn’t make me a good fighter, but it did give me more self-knowledge than an equivalent amount of therapy. 
====
I know that if you tell someone “we should keep in touch,” you will not keep in touch. Instead say, “I’m going to schedule a phone call with you in two months to catch up, I’ll send you the invite - if we need to adjust when we get closer to the date, that’s fine.”
====
I am not the funniest person, but I am funny enough, and I know how to become funnier if you’re not naturally gifted at comedy. Simply say the stupidest things that enter your head, in a normal tone of voice.
====
I know that it’s easy to observe when people are feeling insecure. Notice how much they are mentioning their positive attributes, material possessions, or important friends, when there’s no conversational reason for this to be occurring other than a status claim. It is harder to spot yourself doing this, but it is worth the effort - you are likely doing it occasionally. I certainly do.
====
I know that limerence can be misleading. It can be the beginning of a good relationship, or a complete disaster. If someone feels like the answer to the question of your life, you might want to address the fundamental sense of lack that they are triggering.
====
I know that the legal profession does a great job of identifying competence and rewarding it financially. Cheap lawyers are expensive. 
====
Listening is a neglected social skill. But I know that an even more neglected social skill is candor.
====
I know that there are two modes of experience: appreciative, and evaluative. Concrete example: let’s say you’re listening to a piece of music. Are you sinking into it, awash in emotions? You’re in the appreciative mode. Are you the mixing engineer, listening to the snare hits to make sure they’re consistent? You’re in the evaluative mode. Much of sanity, and happiness, consists of finding the right mode for the right moment. The appreciative mode is terrible for debugging your business plan. But the evaluative mode is terrible for having a first date. A lot of capable, intelligent people suffer because they do not have the ability to switch out of the evaluative mode, or even notice that they’re in it.
====
I know that you cannot skip to the punchline of the cosmic joke. If you’re ambitious, it will be hard to believe that achievement won’t make you completely happy until you accumulate some achievements, and notice the gaps in your happiness. Legend has it that the Buddha woke up at 35, and this seems about right - by your mid-thirties, you have probably been productively disillusioned by at least one serious personal disappointment.
====
I know that some annoying-sounding things that mystics or Zen teachers say, about cosmic oneness or the flow of the Dao, are actually just straightforward descriptions of what the world looks like from a certain point in the contemplative path. “The original face you had before your parents were born” is a phrase that will make perfect, undeniable, beautiful sense if you meditate long enough. And then you will annoy people by trying to explain it.
====
I know that you are almost always not the only one experiencing a person’s challenging attributes. Is your boss being privately abusive to you? They are likely doing it to someone else, or have before. Can’t believe that person is always monopolizing the meeting? Someone else is also annoyed. Now, solving these collective action problems is tricky - but realizing that you’re not alone is the first step.
====
Emotional suppression can be a great short-term coping strategy. The problem, long-term, is that it is not surgically precise. I know you can’t suppress pain and anger without also deadening yourself generally. When I started to release my childhood resentments, I was surprised to find myself surrounded by brighter colors.
====
I know how to throw a good party. Get everyone in large rooms, ideally one large room. Make it feel almost overcrowded, to increase social optionality and accidental touch. It should spill outside a little bit, weather permitting. Have good food and drink in abundance. The ideal volume level creates pockets of intimacy via noise but doesn’t require shouting. The ideal light level is dim-bright. Invite a variety of archetypes—too many high-achievers and it will feel tediously networky, too many slouchy hippies and it will feel like an inert cuddle puddle. Have party smokes if it’s a night party—even very classy people sometimes want a cigarette when they drink, and they will appreciate it so much. If you want your party to be sexy, do not advertise that you want this, just get the gender balance right and lower the lighting a bit, put on the right music, and perhaps assign a costume requirement that will give people license to be outrageous.
====
I know that if your significant other asks you to do an irritating-for-them task that is not especially difficult, you should be thankful. They have given you an unambiguous way to earn points in the relationship, which is how you get a nice life going. Usually, achieving personal flourishing is more complex than taking out the garbage.
====
I know that in a really great relationship or friendship, you should be able to state your needs without explanation. “I need attention.” “Some cheese would make me happy.” “I want to express a feeling that I don’t endorse.” “I am looking for a compliment.” “Can you tell me that I’m cute and good right now?” 
====
I know that disembodiment is a real and pervasive mental issue afflicting cerebral people. The phrase “stuck in your head” isn’t metaphorical, it refers to the arbitrary sense that your perceptual home base is a golfball-sized hole in the middle of your head. I used to have it, and it is a massive downgrade versus correctly perceiving your awareness as a property distributed throughout your head, body, and immediate environment. This is one good resource for tackling the issue, and this is another.
====
I know how to peel ginger. Use a spoon. The first time you do this, you’ll feel like you’re Neo with a fresh brain full of downloaded kung fu skills.
====
I know that if you have a serious dispute with someone, it will go nowhere unless you clearly name the underlying emotion that you’re struggling with. If you’re afraid that your partner will abandon you, cataloging their flaws will not communicate this effectively.
====
No one has ever become poor by giving." - Anne Frank
====
"The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely, or unhappy is to go outside ... Nature brings solace in all troubles." - Anne Frank
====
I know that if you are not unusually hard-working or competitive or smart, you can still distinguish yourself. Be unusual in some other noticeable, likable way—unusually honest, brave, generous, curious, or pleasant. All of these attributes are composed of discrete behaviors that can be learned through practice.
====
I know that you can’t see the counterfactual. Perhaps the stressed-out person you know isn’t convincing when they recommend the calming effects of lavender or exercise. But what you don’t observe is the maniac they would be without their remedies.
====
I know that freedom is earned by confronting things that embarrass and trigger you, over and over again, until you are cringe-proof in your desired environment. 
====
I know that it is powerful to state your weaknesses and limitations. Try this on for size: “I’m abandoning this debate because you are more qualified to have an opinion.” “I’d like to finish this project quickly because I don’t like to work hard.” “I realize that I don’t believe what’s coming out of my mouth.” “I’m worried that I’m taking this decision too seriously and I’m not adding value by fretting over it.”
====
I know that we are all thoughts in the mind of God.
====
I know how to instantly calm yourself, and, in social situations, ground your energy, thus making you more charismatic. Without effort, include the bottom of your feet in your conscious awareness.
====
I know how to handle a day when you feel extremely lazy. Decide that, given that you’re a lazy person, you will work diligently for only 30 entirely focused minutes on the most important thing, and then take the rest of the day off. You will do your best work on these days.
====
“It’s very difficult to be very lazy. It takes a lot of imagination to do nothing and you have to be sufficiently self-confident not to have a bad conscience. You have to have a taste for life, so that every minute is complete in itself and so you don’t have to keep saying ‘I’ve done this or that.’ You need strong nerves to do nothing. Being lazy also means that other people’s opinions don’t matter. Nor does the idea of always having to prove yourself.” - Françoise Sagan
====
I know that among my regrets, one of the sharpest is refusing to accept a sincere apology. Offering an olive branch takes courage. Try to reward this, even from people who you don’t believe deserve forgiveness.
====
I know that intelligent people who are not emotionally or socially aware can be easily fooled and driven insane. You just have to hand them an unsolvable Rubik’s cube and convince them that it is the most important thing in the world. This will trigger their desire to be special, or their fear of being useless or bad, and they will not know this is happening, they’ll just tear their hair out trying to solve the unsolvable Rubik’s cube. Entire social groups and movements are built on this.
====
I know that simplistic stories about happiness leave out crucial details. For example: Yes, relationships are more important than career, ultimately. But some career success might give you a greater ability to locate people you’re compatible with later on, as friends or partners.
====
I know that silence is an underused conversational tactic. It makes people more interesting and builds intimacy.
====
I know that, if you can pull it off, you should continuously have mentors, and be offering mentorship. This can be as formal or informal as you want.
====
I know that almost nobody hears too many sincere compliments. Compliment them to their face. Then, compliment them behind their back. Practice naming pleasant feelings you have about people, as soon as they bubble up, in the moment: “It’s always fun to see you.” Lower the resistance around this to zero.
====
Few things make you stupider than the belief that you need to have an opinion on everything.
====
If you want to be right, don’t try to be right, try to be less wrong. If you want to be smart, don’t try to be smart, try to be curious and humble.
====
No one is paying as much attention to you as you are. People are too concerned with how they appear to others to care much about how you appear to them.
====
Every “overnight success” is the result of years of thankless work. Success comes not from great acts of genius but from doing lots of small things consistently.
====
Failure is a mark of courage. It means you risked failure.
====
Many of the people you disagree with are not stupid, evil, or insane, but have had thoughts and experiences you haven't which led them to different conclusions.
====
In the long run, a lazy lifestyle creates more work and stress than a disciplined one.
====
You’re not inactive because you lack motivation, you lack motivation because you’re inactive. You don't need to feel inspired to start creating, you need to start creating to feel inspired. Action creates traction. All you need is to start and the rest will inevitably follow.
====
A lot of the time your feelings are invalid and you should feel differently.
====
“to be nobody-but-yourself — in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else — means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight.” - E.E. Cummings
====
You should just be yourself, not because it will make you more likable (it won’t) but because it's only by being yourself that you'll find people who like you for who you are rather than for who you're pretending to be.
====
Never argue with stupid people. It's easier to win an argument with a genius than an idiot.
====
Those who fear appearing foolish rarely discover anything new. The genius of tomorrow often looks like an idiot today.
====
“It’s possible that one of the reasons you got on the path of mastery was to look good. But to learn something new of any significance, you have to be willing to look foolish. [...]. If you’re always thinking about appearances, you can never attain the state of concentration that’s necessary for effective learning and top performance.” - George Leonard
====
If you can’t state the opposing view as well as the people who hold it, you shouldn’t feel entitled to your own view.
====
Don’t believe everything you think. The voice in your head is not you, and it’s not honest.
====
“The book is the greatest invention of man. It’s a shame that people read so little.” - José Mujica.
====
Make a habit of reading writers you expect to disagree with. One idea that challenges your beliefs is worth a hundred ideas that confirms them.
====
“I consider reading the greatest bargain in the world. A shelf of books is a shelf of many lives and ideas and imaginations which the reader can enjoy whenever he wishes and as often as he wishes. Instead of experiencing just one life, the book-lover can experience hundreds or even thousands of lives.” - Gene Roddenberry
====
Be careful who you spend your time with, because you’ll become like them.
====
Don’t create the content you think people want to consume, create the content you want to consume. If it interests you, you’ll make it interesting to others.
====
You give the power to whatever you blame.
====
If you allow yourself to be provoked by trolls and narcissists, then you relinquish to them your time and energy, and thereby become their bitch.
====
Avoid people who love to gossip about others. They’re almost certainly gossiping about you.
====
When faced with misfortune, you can pity yourself for suffering it, or commend yourself for surviving it. The first option will extend your suffering, the second will shorten it.
====
Don’t take people too seriously – including yourself. Everyone is just a marketing campaign for their gametes.
====
Don’t take yourself seriously, but do take your work seriously. Do what you say you’re going to do. If you don’t, you’ll lose respect for yourself. And if you don’t respect yourself, you’ll find it effortless to trespass across your own boundaries and violate all that you value.
====
Your future-self would do anything to be you again. Treasure the time you have like you treasure the good old days, because today and tomorrow are the future’s good old days.
====
This form of (analytical) meditation goes beyond watching your mind to actively steer it away from disturbing thoughts, like anxiety, fear, and craving; and toward beneficial ones, like satisfaction, joy, and generosity. Instead of calmly watching whatever comes into your mind like you do in stabilizing meditation, in analytical meditation you actively question what pops into your mind, and proactively cultivate beneficial thoughts and feelings that steer it toward openness, happiness, and compassion. - Scott Snibbe 
====
Is the space of your consciousness dim or bright? Is it clear or obstructed? Does it stay the same or does it change?… Now watch how objects appear within the space of your mind. The signals from your eyes, ears, imagination, and memory transform into forms, sounds, and other perceptions that take shape in your awareness. Whatever texture and color the mind has gets sculpted into the form of what you perceive. See how these mental objects rise and fall within your consciousness. You can bring each appearance closer to examine it or let it fade away. - Scott Snibbe 
====
"If we can’t work smarter, we resort to working harder. We cut out lunch, skip the gym, and run from one meeting to another so we can fit more in. Being busy seems to matter more than getting stuff done."

“The test of a business man is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years, or can make money through the luck of getting into the field first, but whether in a highly competitive field, without having any initial advantage over his competitors, he can outdistance them in a perfect honourable way and keep the respect of himself and of his community.” - Harvey Firestone
====
"Talent without effort is wasted talent. And while effort is the one thing you can control in your life, applying that effort intelligently is next on the list." - Mark Cuban
====
“Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” - Calvin Coolidge, American attorney and politician
====
Most people are brought up believing that if they are a good person, good things will happen to them. While not entirely wrong, it’s not enough to unlock your potential. It's like walking up to a door with two locks and only one key. If you want to go inside, you need the other key. The second key is going positive and going first—proactively helping others. When both keys are used together, the door unlocks, and a previously hidden world of opportunities reveals itself.
====
★ The chief trick to making good mistakes is not to hide them—especially not from yourself. Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind as if they were works of art, which in a way they are. The fundamental reaction to any mistake ought to be this: "Well, I won’t do that again!"
====
It is important to admit your mistakes, and to do so before you are charged with them. Many clients are surrounded by buck-passers who make a fine art of blaming the agency for their own failures. I seize the earliest opportunity to assume the blame. - David Ogilvy

There is a big difference between being interested in something and being committed to something. Committed people do what interested people won’t.
====
"Too many people opt out and never discover their own abilities because they fear failure. They don't understand commitment." - Pat Summitt
====
“Why do we love committers but act like browsers? I think it’s because of three fears. First, we have a fear of regret: we worry that if we commit to something, we will later regret having not committed to something else. Second, we have a fear of association: we think that if we commit to something, we will be vulnerable to the chaos that that commitment brings to our identity, our reputation, and our sense of control. Third, we have a fear of missing out: we feel that if we commit to something, the responsibilities that come with it will prevent us from being everything, everywhere, to everyone. Because of these fears, the tension sticks around. We act like browsers, we love committers, and we’re too scared to make the jump—so we’re stuck.” - Pete Davis
====
Respect others. Clementine Churchill once left a note for her husband. “My Darling Winston,” she wrote, “I must confess that I have noticed a deterioration in your manner; & you are not so kind as you used to be.” Yes, he had power, she noted, but if you keep disrespecting people, “You won’t get the best results.” The way you treat others sets off a chain reaction that shapes your life in profound ways. Disrespect, rudeness, pettiness, jealousy—these things repel. But dignity, equanimity, politeness, calm—they attract. They draw people in. They bring the best out of others. Choose wisely.

Avoid procrastination rule #1: if a task takes less than 2 minutes to complete, do it immediately. If a task is longer that 2 minutes, just start to do it for 2 minutes and you can stop whenever you want. - Daniel Pink, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpYFarx5mUk
====
Avoid procrastination rule #2: Environmental hack: change your surroundings to avoid distractions, I.E. smartphone left in another room. Staying focused with distractions within arm reach takes monumental willpower. - Daniel Pink
====
Avoid procrastination rule #3: Temptation bundling. Pair the thing you need to do with the one you want to do. I.e. exercise while listening to audiobooks or favorite podcasts. - Daniel Pink
====
Avoid procrastination rule #4: Visualize your future regret. Vividly imagine the consequences your future self will face if you keep procrastinating. Figure the last minute panic, the will to kick yourself for not starting earlier. - Daniel Pink

Avoid procrastination rule #5: break big tasks into microtasks to reduce intimidation and the will to distract just to get some relief. - Daniel Pink
====
Avoid procrastination rule #6: make a public commitment. Because breaking a promise with someone is painful. - Daniel Pink
====
Avoid procrastination rule #7: You say to yourself "just 5 more", when you feel your motivation waning. Five more minutes, five more items, five more sentences. Five more units. Over time you train yourself to push a little beyond the point you normally would quit, and that expands your capacity to focus and work. - Daniel Pink

Overthinking is underdoing with better vocabulary.
====
Give, give, give. When Rabbi Harold Kushner wrote a book, he avoided procrastination and overthinking. His only ritual before starting was to make a small donation to a charity he and his wife supported. Like ancient sacrifices to gods before battle, the rabbi waged the war of art by first striking with an act of kindness. Generosity is admirable, and many of us wish we could be better at it. There’s only one way to improve, and it happens to be the same way one gets better at writing or any other craft: by doing it. Not later, once we’re better off or once somebody really needs it. But consistently, regularly, habitually. Money is not the only currency of generosity. You can give your time, your energy, your words of encouragement, your patience, your kindness. Seneca reminds us that every person we meet is an opportunity for kindness. For expressions of generosity. How are you doing? Do you need anything? Can I help you with that? These opportunities are everywhere, every day. Start to seize them. Make a habit of it.

Overthinking is the biggest waste of human energy. Trust yourself, make a decision, and gain more experience. There is no such thing as perfect. You cannot think your way into perfection, just take action. - Sylvester McNutt III

Find the good. During one of his many stints in prison, Gandhi made a pair of sandals for General Jan Smuts, the prime minister of South Africa, who put Gandhi in jail. Somewhere in Smuts, despite his complicity in a racist and exploitative system, there was goodness, Gandhi believed. Smuts wore the sandals and thought of Gandhi’s grace and goodness as he did. Smuts eventually tried to return them, saying he felt unworthy to stand in the shoes of such a great man. To his credit, he made an effort to fill those shoes. He contributed to the founding of the League of Nations, drafted the UN Charter, and helped find a homeland for Jews after the Holocaust. He said Gandhi inspired him to redeem himself. Each of us, the Holocaust survivor Edith Eger would later write, has both a Hitler and a Corrie ten Boom (one of the Righteous Among the Nations honorees) inside us. Which one are you letting out? Which one are you seeing in others?

Choose a north star. I watched Dov Charney go from a hero in the fashion business to one of its villains. In the early days, he was focused on challenging the broken assumptions of the business. He cared about his workers. He cared about the environment. Later, it became all about him, all about his urges, all about his power. This is the power of a north star. It can take you on an amazing journey or get you hopelessly lost. Your values, your aspirations, the things pushing and pulling you—whatever they are, they foretell a prophecy. They determine where you’ll end up…and who you’ll be when you get there. Cash is a bad but easy north star to default to. Same with ego, fame, power, a desire for revenge or dominance—they will lead you astray. Loyalty, mastery, a love of the game, a desire to keep your hands clean, to be an open book, have a clear conscience. These things take you north. They lead you forward. They cut through the noise. Of the cardinal directions, justice is the clearest, the Stoics said—it points you north, shows you where to go. Follow it, and you’ll end up in a good place…and you’ll be a good person when you get there.
====
Hold the line. Your north star will illuminate a line in your life. That is, the line between good and evil, right and wrong, ethical and unethical, fair and unfair. Courage requires you to put your ass on that line. Self-discipline tells you to get your ass in line. Justice is holding that line. It’s what you will do and what you won’t. What you will stand for and what you won’t stand for. It’s the decisions you make, the actions you take. Indeed, all the philosophical and religious traditions–from Confucius to Christianity, Plato to Hobbes and Kant—are best preached not with words but with actions. Each action is like a lantern that hollows darkness and uncertainty. Each decision to do the right thing is a statement that our peers, children, and future generations will hear. So draw the line and hold it.
====
Develop competence. Keeping your word, taking responsibility, having compassion, good intentions, and good values are great. So is wanting to change things, to take on evil or injustice. But these feelings are worthless without competence. Florence Nightingale is often portrayed as an angelic nurse gliding through the halls of hospitals. The reality is much more impressive. She was a tireless seeker of knowledge, a stern teacher and trainer of a generation of talented nurses, a fierce advocate for resources, a diligent fundraiser, and a skilled steward of that money. If a problem is to be solved, it must be studied. If progress is to be made, if positive change is to happen, it will be paved not with good intentions but rock-hard competence. It will require courage, discipline, and wisdom. Of course it will. If change, if being of service, if developing smarts, capability, and competence were easy, everyone would do it and no one would be impressive.
====
Leave this place better than you found it. There’s a sign at the track I used to run at in Austin that reads: “Leave This Place Better Than You Found It.” It was put up by the Hollywood Henderson, who paid for the track (and made the neighborhood better). You don’t have to save the planet. You don’t have to save someone’s life. Can you make sure you pick up a piece of trash when you see it? Can you do something nice for a stranger? Can you just make things a little bit better every day?
====
If you want the highest quality information, you have to speak to the best people. The problem is many people claim to be experts, who really aren’t. Here are some things to look for. - [Experts vs. Imitators](https://fs.blog/experts-vs-imitators/)
====
Everyone wants the summary. But the summary is what's left after someone else decided what matters. Their priorities aren't yours. Their filters aren't yours. When you operate on summaries, you're thinking with someone else's brain.
====
"The biggest problem of success is that the world conspires to stop you doing the thing that you do, because you are successful. There was a day when I looked up and realised that I had become someone who professionally replied to email, and who wrote as a hobby." - Neil Gaiman
====
Actually, shoes have nothing to do with my success. What I’ve accomplished comes down to one thing: my knack for identifying and then solving problems. What I do better than anything else is cut out distractions. If a system isn’t working efficiently, I can see where it's jammed, eliminate the problem, and find a way to keep everything moving forward.” - Paul Van Doren
====
“Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.” - Marie Curie
====
"One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done." - Marie Curie
====
You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. - Marie Curie
====
"It’s the human desire in all of us to want to make life better for somebody else. It makes you feel larger. It makes you feel part of the whole human race. " - Doris Kearns Goodwin
====
Everyone knows what works. Few do it after it stops being exciting.
====
1. Most decisions are reversible. Don’t obsess about making the “right” decision. Define the problem, list out the potential solutions, and choose a path forward. Some decisions are one-way doors, but most are not. - https://calvinrosser.com/40-pieces-of-advice/
====
2. Stop trying to feel happy. Self-help culture tricks you into thinking happiness is around the corner. But humans evolved to survive, not to be happy. If you’re going through a tough time or don’t feel joy at every moment, that’s normal. You’re human.
====
The entire self-help industry in one sentence: Do what makes mornings exciting and nights peaceful.
Will this make me excited to wake up? Will this let me sleep in peace?
Everything that fails both tests is noise.
====
3. It’s not about you. If someone slights you or turns you down, don’t take it personally. Most people are too consumed with their own problems to appreciate what you’re doing or who you are.
====
4. Careers don’t exist. Don’t worry about the narrative of your “career.” Pursue your interests. Take care of your needs. Adapt to new circumstances. And be willing to reinvent yourself at any age.
====
5. Everything gets old. Life is full of diminishing returns. At some point, more money, fame, prestige, travel, or sex won’t make you any happier. Learn to recognize when you have “enough.”
====
6. Life is not “fair.” Life favors people already at the top. But regardless of where you started, you can improve your circumstances. Waiting for the world to be fair is a losing strategy.
====
7. No one knows what they’re doing. People come up with fancy stories about their lives, but no one has life figured out. If you’re confused or uncertain about your life, that’s how it’s supposed to be.
====
8. Ignore most advice. If you ask for advice, most people tell you what they would do. But you aren’t them. Learn to trust yourself. And check your thinking with the rare people who will take the time to step into your shoes.
====
9. Everyone can teach you something. Even your obnoxious political foe can teach you something. Learn to let go of your initial judgments and try to understand people. Talk less. Listen more. Get curious about how people came to be who they are.
====
10. Give back before you’re ready. No amount of money or success will make you feel ready to give back. Giving is a habit, and it’s one worth developing. Start giving today, and give more tomorrow.
====
11. Be grateful for what you don’t have. Life can always be much worse than it is today. Instead of obsessing about what’s going wrong, be grateful for all the horrible things that you don’t have.
====
12. Show up. Consistent and focused effort beats talent in the long run. Daily actions compound in remarkable ways. To excel at anything, pick a direction, make a little progress every day, and keep going.
====
13. Actions reveal your beliefs. You’re defined by what you do, not by what you say. Fancy words don’t make up for a sloppy character.
====
14. Speak with people older than you. Older people may not be up with the times, but they can teach you a lot about what actually matters in life. One day with older people can prevent a decade of wasted time on meaningless pursuits.
====
15. Write about your life. Journal often. Write about the mundane details of your life. You’ll forget almost everything that happens to you. But reading an old journal will remind you of how wonderful life can be and how much you’ve grown.
====
16. Say no to almost everything. Very few things matter on a 10-year time horizon. Get used to saying no to things that you don’t want to do. Life’s too short to please everyone.
====
17. Say sorry more often. When you’ve made a mistake, take responsibility. Listen to the person you slighted, give a genuine apology, and commit to being better in the future. If a relationship is important, apologize even when you feel like you’re not in the wrong.
====
18. Bad experiences often become good stories. Time heals most wounds. What seems unbearable in the moment often becomes something to laugh about in the future.
====
19. Choose optimism. Pessimism is more persuasive than optimism. But optimism in the face of a difficult situation is what motivates people to find a way forward.
====
Optimism is a performance-enhancing drug that's both legal and free.
While experts predicted failure, Sam Walton opened discount stores in small towns. When critics said 'too risky,' FedEx launched overnight delivery.
While pessimists write reports, optimists write history.
====
20. Follow your energy. If something in your life feels off, listen to your gut. Leave a relationship. Change your career. You can’t always connect the dots forward.
====
21. Listen for the birds. Birds chirp everywhere in the world. But when you’re wrapped up with your inner drama, you won’t hear them. When you’re calm and present, you will. Pursue a life of inner stillness. The birds will let you know when you’re on track.
====
22. Go for it. Lead a daring life. Try new activities. Challenge yourself. Stop obsessing about what other people think. Just send it, but know your limits.
====
23. Read books. Books allow you to transcend the limitations of your direct experience. They help you tap into centuries of wisdom from the world’s greatest thinkers. Books teach you how to live, how to be a good person, how to lead, and how to succeed. Read more books.
====
24. Go for a walk. A long walk can free you from even the most vicious of mental prisons.
====
25. Slow down. Life passes quickly. Learn to slow down and enjoy what you have today, especially if you’re ambitious and driven. You can always get more done tomorrow.
====
“It’s true that becoming an empathic listener takes time, but it doesn’t take any-where near as much time as it takes to back up and correct misunderstandings when you’re already miles down the road, to redo, and to live with unexpressed and unsolved problems.” - Stephen Covey on how going slow in the moment means you go faster
====
26. Progress is motivating. Motivation is not predictable, so you can’t rely on it. The most powerful way to increase your motivation is to take action and make progress.
====
27. Be charitable in your views of others. Most people are good. They want the same things that you do. If someone has a bad idea or makes a mistake, they’re not a bad person. Assume that everyone is doing their best.
====
28. Don’t wait for the money. Waiting until you’re “financially free” to make the decisions you want is a mistake. Money unlocks more choices, but it doesn’t change the way you operate. If you want to do something, do it now. Don’t wait for the money.
====
29. Progress isn’t linear. Self-help wants you to believe that you always need to be improving. This idea sells more self-help, but it’s not how life works. Progress isn’t linear. Sometimes what you need most is to do nothing & chill.
====
30. Inner peace > external achievement. Many “successful” people are miserable on the inside. Avoid this trap. No amount of achievement will give you inner peace. Learn to be at peace with yourself, independent of what you have or what other people think about you. -BEST-
====
31. Be around people who want the best for you. Be ruthless about removing negative and toxic people from your life. Especially during hard times, you need people who want the best for you.
====
32. Stop overthinking. If you want something, go for it. Don’t wait for someone to come along and move you closer toward your goal. Don’t try to think your way into the future. Decide what you want. And find some small way to inch closer to that outcome today.
====
33. Choose courage over comfort. Don’t allow the comfort of your present reality to stop you from striving to be more in the future. Experiment and fail often. Aim to live a bold life without regrets.
====
34. Focus on today. Everything you want to achieve starts with what you do today. Make plans for the future. But remember that what you do today creates the future. You only exist right now.
====
35. Choose your response: You can choose how you respond to anything you face in life. If an obstacle comes your way, try to learn something from the challenge. When negative feelings arise, try to see the good and naturalness in them.
====
36. Pay it forward. If someone helps you, pay it forward by helping someone else. Don’t underestimate the power of a small act of kindness.
====
37. Take care of yourself. Develop good habits. Spend as much time as you can walking, meditating, and playing. Never miss an opportunity to be with someone you love.
====
38. Balance the “doing” and “being” mind. The “doing mind” is about getting things done and achieving goals. The “being mind” is about accepting your reality without feeling pressure to change it. Find the right balance between these two modes of operating.
====
39. Feel your pain. Life is hard. Make friends with your negative emotions. Don’t cover them up with excessive food, booze, or other short-term remedies. Find the courage to sit with your pain.
====
40. Don’t take shortcuts. Commit to a life of choosing long-term respect over short-term popularity. Do what you say you’re going to do when you say you’re going to do it.
====
1. For the longest time, I thought I needed to be more organized. Now I know I just needed less stuff.
====
2. Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
====
3. White space is where the magic happens.
====
4. The best way to get rid of things you don’t need, is to get rid of things you don’t need.
====
5. Make room for things that matter by removing everything that doesn’t.
====
6. The greatest thing about a simple life is having one.
====
7. Busy schedules make busy people.
====
8. Twenty pairs of jeans is fifteen too many.
====
9. You might get 85 years on this planet—don’t spend 65 paying off a lifestyle you can’t afford.
====
10. Abundance is a full heart, not a full house.
====
11. If you don’t have time to do what matters, stop doing things that don’t.
====
12. I don’t say no because I’m so busy, I say no because I don’t want to be so busy.
====
13. If you have to buy stuff, to store your stuff, maybe you have too much stuff.
====
14. If organizing your stuff worked, you’d be organized by now.
====
15. Instead of working so hard to make ends meet, work on having fewer ends.
====
16. Just because everything is crazy around you, doesn’t mean it has to be crazy within you.
====
17. I learned that thinking about living is not the same as living.
====
18. Without grace, minimalism is another metric for perfection.
====
19. Here is the secret to subtraction. It doesn’t matter what you remove. What matters is that you stop adding it back.
====
20. My goal is no longer to get more done, but rather to have less to do.
====
21. Your home is living space, not storage space.
====
22. Decluttering is infinitely easier when you think of it as deciding what to keep, rather than deciding what to throw away.
====
23. At some point I realized that I wasn’t organizing my life; I was organizing my clutter.
====
24. Owning less is better than organizing more.
====
25. You can make more money, but you can’t make more time.
====
26. Owning less is great. Wanting less is better.
====
27. You don’t need more space, you need less stuff.
====
28. If you are not content today, there is nothing you can buy this weekend to change that.
====
29. Maybe everything you want is underneath everything you don’t.
====
30. If buying stuff hasn’t made you happy, maybe getting rid of it will.
====
31. The first step in crafting a life you want is to get rid of everything you don’t.
====
32. The best things in life aren’t things.
====
33. Addition by subtraction.
====
34. Forget sale price. Everything is 100% off when you don’t buy it.
====
35. The things you own end up owning you.
====
36. Love people, use things. The opposite never works.
====
37. Simplicity boils down to two steps: Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest.
====
38. Stop waiting for the right person to come into your life. Be the right person to come to someone’s life.
====
39. Slowly cut things out until you’re left only with what you love, with what’s necessary, with what makes you happy.
====
40. Spend less time worrying about what you might regret and more time doing what you won’t.
====
41. Simple living doesn’t solve all my problems, it just removes distractions.
====
42. You are not defined by your stuff—the stuff you keep or the stuff you give away.
====
43. Being busy isn’t the same as being productive.
====
44. Small matters, small gets you started, and small adds up.
====
45. If your stuff isn’t serving you, it won’t be serving you any better packed away in a box somewhere.
====
46. You’ve already taken the first step toward an awesome life by simply wanting one.
====
47. Spend money because it’s an investment in your own well-being, not because you’re bored and have nothing else to do.
====
48. A home that nourishes life embraces the little moments and appreciates the rhythmic seasons of life.
====
49. Do the choices I make line up with how I really want to live?
====
50. To realize that the real hidden cost of everything you buy—is how much life it cost you to get it.
====
1. Goodhart’s Law:
When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to be a good measure.
Since schools started to use test-scores as targets, they’ve gradually stopped teaching kids how to live fulfilling lives, and now mainly teach them how to pass school tests (See also: Campbell’s Law).
====
2. Hotelling's Law:
Rival products (burgers, pop songs, political parties) tend to grow more alike over time, because creators copy more successful rivals to replicate their success and steal their customers/audiences.
Paradoxically, this increases the value of being different.
====
3. Herostratic Fame:
Many people would rather be hated than unknown. In Ancient Greece, Herostratus burned down the Temple of Artemis purely so he’d be remembered. Now we have “nuisance influencers” who stream themselves committing crimes and harassing people purely for clout.
====
4. Segal’s Law:
“A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with 2 watches is never sure.”
Ancient societies followed a single narrative. Modern societies are cacophonies of competing narratives. Without trust, more data doesn’t make us more informed but more confused.
====
5. The Reading Recession:
There is more text than ever, yet people are reading ever less and outsourcing writing to chatbots. This is dangerous because language is the basis of thought, and if you can’t read or write well, you won’t think well.
====
6. Beginner's Bubble Effect:
"You cannot learn what you think you already know."
—Epictetus
The most ignorant people are not those who know nothing, but those who know a little, because a little knowledge grants the illusion of understanding, which kills curiosity and closes the mind.
====
7. Parkinson's Law:
Work expands to fill the time allotted for it. No matter the size of the task, it will often take precisely the amount of time you set aside to do it, because more time means more deliberation & procrastination.
The underlying principle, known as induced demand, applies to many other resources: Software expands to fill memory (Wirth’s law), patients expand to fill hospital beds (Roemer's law), energy consumption expands to meet supply (Jevon’s paradox), road congestion expands to fill roads (Braess’ paradox).
====
8. Benford's Law of Controversy:
We tend to fill gaps in information with emotion. We fear what we don’t understand, love what we naively romanticize, etc. As such, the things that fire people up most are usually the things they understand least.
====
9. Pareidolia:
We see whatever we look for.
For aeons, survival favored the paranoid—those able to discern a predator from the vaguest outline. From these survivors we inherited hyperactive pattern-detection, which once saved us from the lions, but now curses us to see them even in the skies.
====
10. Safetyism:
After US schools banned peanuts because some kids had allergies, more kids developed peanut allergies from lack of exposure. We’re increasingly protecting kids from life, which only makes them more vulnerable to it. Too much safety is dangerous.
====
11. Phronemophobia:
Wilson et al. (2014) found that people with nothing to do except think or give themselves an electric shock would often choose the shock. Many of us are so eager to avoid ourselves that we’d rather do something harmful than do nothing at all.
====
12. Serial-Position Effect:
We tend to recall the beginnings (Primacy effect) and endings (Recency effect) of things better than the middles. So if you create anything with a beginning & ending, focus more effort there.
(Don't worry, I’m saving the best concepts for last…)
====
13. Licensing Effect:
Believing you’re good can make you behave bad. Those who consider themselves virtuous worry less about their own behavior, making them more susceptible to ethical lapses. A big cause of immorality is self-righteous morality.
====
14. Preference Falsification:
If people are afraid to say what they really think, they will instead lie. Therefore, punishing speech - whether by taking offence or by threatening censorship - is ultimately a request to be deceived.
====
15. Nutpicking:
Online political debate mainly involves cherry-picking the most outlandish members of the enemy side and presenting them as indicative in order to make the entire side look crazy.
The culture war is essentially just each side sneering at the other side's lunatics.
====
16. Moral Pollution:
We act like bad reputations are contagious, and mere proximity to something labelled immoral is itself immoral. Brands cut ties with people deemed unethical not because they value ethics, but because they fear contamination. Cancellation is moral quarantine.
====
17. KISS Principle:
The design of everything is gradually being stripped down, because simple is easy & safe; the less there is, the less there is to offend or justify. But such rampant minimalism comes at a cost; our cultures are losing their uniqueness and identity.
====
Keep your distance from people who've made being wronged their identity. They're not looking for solutions, they're recruiting.
====
18. Cosmic Schmuck Principle:
There are two kinds of people in this world: those who sometimes worry that they’re a moron, and actual morons.
In other words, the best way to be less of an idiot is to treat yourself like one.
====
19. Cynical Genius Illusion:
Cynical people are widely seen as smarter, but sizable research suggests they actually tend to be dumber. Cynicism is not a sign of intelligence but a substitute for it, a way to shield oneself from betrayal & disappointment without having to do or think.
====
20. Boxer’s Child Paradox:
Each generation tries to make life better for the next, but this deprives future generations of the ordeals needed to build character. In our relentless quest for ever more convenience, are we dooming posterity to weakness?
====
21. Substitution Hypothesis:
We’re wired for faith, so as we kill the old gods, we create new ones to replace them. New Atheism gave rise to Atheism+, a quasi-religion dedicated to “social justice”. In the spiritual void left by receding religion, many now worship "wokeness", with a new Original Sin (whiteness) and Holy Trinity (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion).
====
22. Ambiguity Aversion:
People tend to find uncertain outcomes less tolerable than bad outcomes. De Berker et al (2016) found that test participants who were told they had a small chance of receiving an electric shock exhibited much higher stress levels than those who knew they’d certainly receive an electric shock.
====
23. Semantic Stopsign:
One way people end discussions is by disguising descriptions as explanations. For instance, the word "evil" is used to explain behavior but really only describes it. It resolves the question not by creating understanding but by killing curiosity.
====
24. Toothbrush Problem:
Psychologists treat theories like toothbrushes; no self-respecting person wants to use another’s. Theorists are incentivized by ego and professional pressures to overly rely on their own theories, so they often ignore the best models in favor of their own, applying them ever more widely, contorting them till they’re warped.
====
25. Ferguson Effect:
Black Lives Matter activism reduced policing of black communities, causing murder rates to spike, and a net loss of thousands of black lives. BLM activists insist this effect is a myth, but multiple recent studies, such as Cheng & Long (2022) and Campbell (2023), suggest it’s real.
====
26. Shiny Object Syndrome:
We’re drawn to whatever’s new, because in our evolutionary history new info tended to matter. But now it doesn’t, because 99% of new info is clickbait, mass-produced and rushed-out to exploit our attraction to novelty. So stop chasing the new and seek info that’s stood the test of time.
====
27. Agenda-Setting Theory:
Most of the time, what’s happening in the news isn’t actually important, it only appears important because it’s in the news. The public conversation is based on whatever's reported by the press, giving the impression that this news matters most, when really it's just what was chosen by a few editors and thoughtlessly amplified by the masses.
====
28. Compassion Fade:
“One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.”
When presented with two appeals for charity—one based on famine statistics and one based on a single starving girl—people tend to donate much more to the girl.
Our minds can’t grasp big numbers, so we navigate the world through stories, not statistics. We’re moved by drama, not data.
====
29. Yes-Damn Effect:
You enthusiastically say yes to plans in the future, but when the time actually comes, you often regret it.
The future seems like a different world, distant and infinite in capacity, so you stuff it with plans and forget about it, passing the buck to your future self.
Trouble is, your future self tends to be a lot like you. So if you wouldn't want to do something today, don't agree to do it next month.
====
30. Generation Effect:
If you really want to understand a topic, don’t read about it, write about it. The act of explaining something helps connect the dots and commit them to memory far better than the passive act of reading. It’s a big reason I make these lists!

Nine sources of advantage:
- Raw talent/intelligence - Some people are just naturally better and smarter.
- Hard work - Some people work harder.
- Differentiation - Seeing the world differently. Doing something different. Reading different books. Interpreting the same information differently.
- Process / Discipline - Creating a process and following it. Working out every day is a great example.
- Talent Collector - The ability to hire the best people and get the most out of them.
- Patience - A lack of patience changes the outcome.
- Ability to take pain - Are you willing to look like an idiot to get better? How much risk are you willing to take, AND, importantly, can you handle the losses?
- Temperament - Keeping your head when everyone else is losing theirs.
- Luck

“If you're busy showing off your brains, you're probably not listening closely enough, thinking hard enough or reaching the smartest conclusions.” - Strauss Zelnick

Dysrationalia: Just because someone is intelligent, doesn’t mean their intelligence is pursuing intelligent goals. Many genius-level intellects are put into the service of idiotic delusions.
====
Gibson's Law: In matters of law and policy, anyone can find a subject-matter expert who supports their view, because having a PhD doesn’t necessarily make someone right, it often just makes them more skilled at being wrong.

Mismatch Theory: Moths evolved to navigate by the moon, a good strategy until the invention of electric lamps, which now lead them astray. Equally, humans evolved to be tribal, a good strategy until the Digital Age, where it now leads us to act like polarized goons online.
====
St. George in Retirement Syndrome: Many who fight injustice come to define themselves by their fight against injustice, so that, as they defeat the injustice, they must invent new injustices to fight against simply to maintain their identity.
====
Idiocy Saturation: Online, people who don't think before they post are able to post more often than people who do. As a result, the average social media post is stupider than the average social media user.
====
The difference between failure and success is often just staying with a problem a little longer. One more rep. One more step. One more minute. One more revision. One more attempt. The difference between average and outstanding is often just one more.
====
If you see someone failing to take action, it tells you they don't know the cost of inaction. Just because the cost of inaction is invisible doesn't mean it's not real. What happens if you don't take action? Nothing. The cost of inaction is the status quo. If you're ok where you are, then you don't need to do anything. But if you want to get to the next level, you need to understand the cost of doing nothing. Action is expensive, but inaction costs a fortune.
====
Recognize the difference between thoughts and facts. “Thoughts are not facts. They are a mix of opinions, judgements, stories, memories, theories, interpretations, and predictions about the future… Just as thoughts are not facts, feelings are not facts either. Emotions are information, but when that information is powerful, intense and loud, as emotions can be, then we are more vulnerable to believing in them as a true reflection of what is going on. I feel it therefore it must be a fact. Emotional reasoning is a thought bias that leads us to use what we feel as evidence for something to be true, even when there might be plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise.”
====
If you want to feel less anxious about something, do it as often as you can. “When we feel anxious about something, the most natural human response is to avoid it. We know that if we stay away, we’ll feel safe, for now. But avoidance not only maintains anxiety, it makes it worse over time… The things you do most of the time become your comfort zone. So, if you want to feel less anxious about something, do it as often as you can.”
====
Don’t associate failure with unworthiness. “If we associate failure with unworthiness, then starting anything new is going to feel overwhelming and procrastination will be front and center. We protect ourselves from the psychological threat of shame by sabotaging the process before it gets started.”
====
Choose the thought worth paying attention to. “Allowing all thoughts to be present, but choosing which ones we give our time and attention to, can have a powerful impact on our emotional experience.”
====
“There is a Scandinavian saying which some of us might well take as a rallying cry for our lives: The north wind made the Vikings! Wherever did we get the idea that secure and pleasant living, the absence of difficulty, and the comfort of ease, ever of themselves made people either good or happy? Upon the contrary, people who pity themselves go on pitying themselves even when they are laid softly on a cushion, but always in history character and happiness have come to people in all sorts of circumstances, good, bad, and indifferent, when they shouldered their personal responsibility. So, repeatedly the north wind has made the Vikings.” - Harry Emerson Fosdick, The Power to See it Through
====
“There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried." - Emerson, Essay on Self-reliance
====
“Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.” - Jeff Bezos
====
“The most important thing is to stay focused on what matters. Most little things ultimately have no effect on an enterprise. It's the big deals - and the big decisions that do. Don't spend too much time on little things. The important choices and opportunities are the ones that move the dial.” - Larry Tisch

In the long term, you can't get better results than your consistency.
====
Not all progress is visible. Not all victories are celebrated. Just because others can't see the results doesn't mean you're not getting better. Just because someone is ahead of you doesn't mean you are on the wrong trajectory. Just because no one notices doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Just because there is no applause doesn't mean you didn't score.

2. The DOVE & ROPE rules of brainstorming
There are many brainstorming methods. But the key principles are pretty stable. Alex Osborn (1888 – 1966), who is considered the father of brainstorming, devised a handy mnemotechnique to remember the rules of brainstorming, DOVE, which stands for:
Deferral of judgment | Off-beat ideas | Vast quantities of ideas | Elaboration/expansion of ideas
> Darryn Kruse, a campus principal and teacher, created a slightly different version, the ROPE method of brainstorming:
Record all ideas | Original ideas are encouraged (no stupid ideas) | Put off evaluation (judgement can be done later) | Expand on other’s ideas
====
Some people get used to sloppy thinking in many areas of their lives, thinking that those situations are low-stakes or just for fun, so they don't matter.
While, of course, the effort we put into our thinking should depend on the importance of that topic, without a habit of engaging in critical thinking and lots of practice doing it well, it's unlikely we'll suddenly be able to turn it on effectively when it actually matters.
Aiming to use critical thinking only when it really matters is like not bothering to learn to swim well, assuming you'll be able to figure out how to swim once you've fallen overboard. Except, without critical thinking, you won't even know when you've fallen overboard.
====
3. CAMPER questions for critical thinking. This set of questions can be used when consuming content to practice critical thinking and to think  	better.
Consequences: What are the consequences of believing this?
Consistency: How consistent is the information?
Assumptions: What assumptions have been made here?
Accuracy: How accurate is the data or information?
Meaning: What is the meaning of this?
Main Points: What are the main points?
Prejudice: What prejudice is being shown here?
Point of View: What other points of view could be expressed?
Evidence: What evidence is there to support the position or claims?
Examples: What examples are there to back-up the position or claims?
Relevance: How relevant is the position or claims?
Reliability: How reliable is the information, writer or source?
These are particularly helpful when you instinctively agree or disagree with a piece of information, as it may be a sign of subjective thinking.

“Many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.” - William Fitzjames Oldham

Your mindset is either your launchpad or hamster wheel. 
If you feel stuck, question the roof. 
Break it. Replace it.
Or upgrade it.

4. Five Whys
Five Whys is an iterative interrogative technique. By repeating the question “why?” five times in a row, the technique is used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem, with the primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a problem.
Here is an example of using the Five Whys technique, where a project wasn’t launched on time:
Why wasn’t the project launched on time? Because there was a missing piece.
Why was there a missing piece? Because the team didn’t know how to implement it.
Why didn’t the team know how to implement it? Because they didn’t know how to.
Why didn’t they know how to? Because they were not properly trained.
Why weren’t they properly trained? Because no training is offered for this particular piece.
Root problem: the project wasn’t launched on time because there is currently no team training provided to implement a critical piece.
====
5. Think-Pair-Share
Think-Pair-Share is a simple collaborative thinking tool to use with a thinking buddy to debug a problem together, then share back what you found with the team.
Think: each person separately thinks about the problem and writes down their thoughts.
Pair: consolidate individual thoughts together.
Share: share back with the rest of the team.

The least effective form of patience is passive.A person who is passively patient waits for the universe to give them what they think they deserve. Five years from now, they'll still be waiting. Passive patience violates Newton's third law, which states, 'For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.' No action. No result. The world isn't indebted to you, and no one is destined to come your way, tap your shoulder, and present you with the golden opportunity you've been waiting for. It doesn't work that way.
The most effective form of patience is active patience. Active patience implies taking significant steps today to set yourself up for future success. It's about strategically preparing for what lies ahead—saving more than you spend and investing wisely, developing the necessary skills for future job prospects, choosing kindness over cleverness, and so on. Here is the key lesson: Active patience puts the world on your side. If you go positive and go first, and you do so consistently, the world does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

1. Bat-and-Ball Problem: A bat and ball cost $1.10 total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? If you guessed $0.10, wrong! It’s $0.05. You missed the “more than the ball”. When we react instinctively, we react to a simplification of reality.
====
2. Selective Laziness: We scrutinize the opinions of others more closely than our own. Trouche et al. (2016) found that people often reject their own opinions if tricked into believing they’re someone else’s. To properly evaluate your beliefs, imagine they’re someone else’s.
====
3. Moravec's Paradox: What is easy for humans is hard for AI, and vice versa. Differential calculus requires far less compute than merely climbing steps. Thus, AI may replace most white collar jobs before it replaces most blue collar ones.
====
“As soon as it works, no one calls it AI any more.” - John McCarthy, an early AI pioneer in the 70s
====
4. Price Anchoring: Retailers often briefly raise the price of an item so they can then reduce it to RRP and advertize it as a big saving. So when you buy a “discounted” item on Black Friday, etc, you often just bought it at normal price. To avoid this, use online price-trackers.
====
5. Health Halo Effect: We assume food products are healthy based on claims like “low fat” and “sugar free”, but foods stripped of fat/salt/sugar often require the addition of even unhealthier substances (emulsifiers, preservatives, artificial sweeteners).
====
6. Solomon's Paradox: We're better at solving other people's problems than our own, because detachment yields objectivity. But Kross et al. (2014) found viewing oneself in the 3rd person yields the same detachment, so when trying to help yourself, imagine you're helping a friend.
====
7. Celine’s 3rd Law: An honest politician is more dangerous than a corrupt one. A corrupt politician is only interested in enriching himself. An honest, idealistic politician actually wants to change the world, so he stands a real chance of wrecking everything.
====
8. The Friendship Recession: Americans without any friends have increased 400% since 1990. A meta-analysis suggests that loneliness increases mortality as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. As society continues to atomize, this issue will only get worse.
====
9. Rothbard’s Law: If a talent comes naturally to someone, they assume it’s nothing special, and instead try to improve at what seems difficult to them. Therefore, people often specialize in things they're bad at. (I think this one explains my life trajectory.)
====
10. The Narcissist's Prayer: “That didn’t happen. And if it did, it wasn’t that bad. And if it was, that’s not a big deal. And if it is, that’s not my fault. And if it was, I didn’t mean it. And if I did, you deserved it.”. Beware of serial rationalizers moving goalposts in order to DARVO. You’ll persuade them of nothing, and they’ll persuade themselves of anything.
====
11. Dartmouth Scar: Kleck (1980) told his research subjects they’d engage in a study to test discrimination. He painted scars on some of their faces, and then had them attend job interviews. The participants with scars painted on their faces reported feeling discriminated against for their looks. However, unknown to them, their scars had been removed before they entered the interviews. It would seem we can be victimized by the mere belief that we’re a victim.
====
12. Dunning-Kruger Effect: We don’t know what we don’t know. As such, stupid people are too stupid to realize how stupid they are. This is why it’s easier to win an argument against a genius than an idiot.
====
13. Revenge Bedtime Procrastination: You don’t want the night to end and the dreaded morning to begin, so you procrastinate going to bed, as if by doing so you can prevent tomorrow ever coming. But tomorrow *will* come, and if you don’t sleep well, it’ll hit you all the harder.
====
14. Bias Blindspot: Whenever I post about a bias or fallacy, I’ll receive replies from leftists claiming it explains rightist views and rightists claiming it explains leftist views. Not once will people claim it explains their own side’s views. The belief that bias is just something that affects our opponents is our greatest source of bias.
====
15. Crazy Bastard Hypothesis: Why do young men commonly endanger their lives with reckless behavior? Fessler et al (2014) found that people view risk-prone men as larger and stronger. Thus, seemingly crazy male behavior may actually be a fitness signal.
====
16. Compounding: To win big, do small things consistently. Since human brains think linearly, we vastly underestimate the exponential effects of cumulative small actions. In 2005, Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald traded his way from a paperclip to a house in just 14 transactions.
====
17. The Never-Ending Now: We're always chasing the latest info, but this tends to be junk whose main selling point is novelty, not quality. Instead of new info, seek that which has stood the test of time: classic literature, proven theorems, replicated studies.
====
18. Cromwell's Rule: Science is never settled, and certainty is the death of thought. Therefore, unless judging a self-evident statement (e.g. 2+2=4), always leave room for doubt in every assumption. Instead of thinking in certainties, think in probabilities: not “that is the case” but “that is likely the case”.
====
19. Problem Selling: Problem-solvers take an issue and break it down into small solvable chunks. Problem-sellers (e.g. politicians, the press) do the opposite, blaming many small issues on one big problem that looks insurmountable and terrifying.
====
20. Celine’s 2nd Law: Honest communication occurs only between equals. If one person has power over another, then the less powerful person can’t risk saying what they really think. Thus, in any hierarchy, honest communication only travels horizontally.
====
21. Snapchat Dysmorphia (aka Selfie Dysmorphia): The Instagram arms race of lip fillers & beauty filters creates unrealistic beauty standards for girls, causing them to hate how they look. Their desire to escape themselves may help explain the surge in plastic surgery (and, perhaps, gender dysphoria.)
====
22. Counterfeit Fitness: Men’s main driver for pursuing greatness is to get laid. But porn & sexbots offer men the illusion of getting laid without the need to “earn” it, so men are quickly losing their main motivation for bettering themselves.
====
23. Fanbaiting: Ideas that divide spread further than ideas everyone agrees with. Film studios portray a white character or historical figure as black, which stokes outrage and divides the internet, and as everyone complains or defends it they all unwittingly publicize the movie.
====
24. Bonhoeffer's Theory of Stupidity: Evil can be guarded against. Stupidity cannot. And the world's few evil people have little power without the help of the world's many stupid people. Therefore, stupidity is a far greater threat than evil.
====
25. Mating Mind Hypothesis: Why did we evolve a sense of humor? Comedy requires subverting expectations and connecting the seemingly unconnected. It's a reliable signal of creativity, so we evolved to look for it in mates, and to use it to attract mates. May also help explain our appreciation for art.
====
26. Switch Cost Effect: We simultaneously inhabit 2 worlds—online & off—and both regularly interrupt us with demands/notifications, so we’re never able to settle in either. The constant switching of attention apparently lowers working IQ by ~10, dumbifying us twice as much as being high on cannabis.
====
27. St. George in Retirement Syndrome: Many who fight injustice come to define themselves by their fight against injustice, so that, as they defeat the injustice, they must invent new injustices to fight against simply to retain a sense of purpose in life.
====
28. Crab Mentality (aka Tall Poppy Syndrome): On social media, people will attack those they envy or desire to bring them down and assuage their own feelings of inferiority. If they have no pride in their accomplishments, they’ll instead take pride in your failures.
====
29. Gurwinder’s Theory of Bespoke Bullshit: Many don’t have an opinion until they’re asked for it, at which point they cobble together a viewpoint from whim & half-remembered hearsay, before deciding that this 2-minute-old makeshift opinion will be their new hill to die on.
====
30. Explore-Exploit Tradeoff: The young own little so have little to lose, and are free to experiment and overturn norms. The old own much so can’t risk experimenting, and need stability to safeguard the lives they’ve built. I believe this is a key reason people become more conservative with age.
====
31. Celine's 1st Law: National security is the chief cause of national insecurity. Government attempts to stop a threat to security lead it to draft harsher laws and to spy on its citizens, which eventually becomes a greater threat than that which it’s protecting against.
====
32. Idea Laundering: How do "kind" falsehoods like "sex is a spectrum" and "obesity is healthy" go mainstream? Activists with PhDs use academic journals & scientific jargon to disguise ideology as knowledge, which is then cited as fact by the media & Wikipedia.
====
33. Shopping Cart Theory: Returning a shopping cart is considerate, quick, and easy, so it’s an extremely low bar of unselfishness to clear. Therefore, someone who doesn't return shopping carts without good reason (e.g. disability) likely has the principles of an alley cat, and is only being kept in check by laws.
====
34. Galloway’s Razor: Research suggests people enjoy possessions less than they expected, and they enjoy experiences more than they expected. In the end, people value what they did much more than what they owned. So choose adventures over luxury items.
====
35. Reframing: When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. If you feel life sucks, don’t say “life sucks” but “I think life sucks right now.” This shifts the problem from the world to your mind, and it's easier to change your mind than the world.
====
36. Hebb's Rule: Neurons that fire together wire together. When you repeatedly think or act a certain way, your brain begins to physically rewire itself to facilitate that thought or action. You literally become what you repeatedly do. So choose your habits wisely.
====
37. Hedonic Treadmill: Once we've obtained what we desire, our happiness quickly returns to its baseline level, and we begin to desire something else. Whatever we get, we get used to. Therefore, contentment lies not in accumulating possessions, but in relinquishing desires.
====
38. Crabtree's Bludgeon: It’s possible to create a coherent explanation for any set of observations—even ones that are mutually contradictory. In other words, there is at least one seemingly rational argument to justify even the most idiotic bullshit. So be careful.
====
39. The Arc of Happiness: Self-reported happiness graphed by age is smile-shaped. The optimism of youth becomes cynicism as responsibilities mount & dreams collide with reality. But after midlife, happiness rises again as people accept reality and learn to enjoy the little things.
====
40. Epistemic Luck: You know that if you’d lived in a different place or time, read different books, had different friends, you’d have different beliefs. And yet, you’re convinced that your current beliefs are correct. So, are you wrong, or the luckiest person ever?
====
Go small: “If everyone has the same number of hours in the day, why do some people seem to get so much more done than others? How do they do more, achieve more, earn more, have more? If time is the currency of achievement, then why are some able to cash in their allotment for more chips than others? The answer is they make getting to the heart of things the heart of their approach. They go small. Going small is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do. It’s recognizing that not all things matter equally and finding the things that matter most. It’s a tighter way to connect what you do with what you want. It’s realizing that extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.”
====
Behind every great achievement lies a long, unseen journey.
====
Results are forged from invisible efforts.
That hit song? Years of practice, countless unheard tracks.
The championship athlete? Countless hours of unseen training.
The successful entrepreneur? Working on a Friday night, again.
The invisible advantage is choosing to do what other people could do, but don't.
====
Ride the virtuous circle of passion-practice-skill: “Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.”
====
“If you're not passionate about the field you're engaged in you won't have the grit or perseverance to compete with those who are.” - Ken Griffin
====
"Passion is what makes life interesting." - Pat Tillman
====
Decide your future by deciding your habits: “People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.”
====
Imagine life is a game in which you are juggling five balls: “The balls are called work, family, health, friends, and integrity. And you’re keeping all of them in the air. But one day you finally come to understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. The other four balls—family, health, friends, integrity—are made of glass. If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed, nicked, perhaps even shattered.”
====
1. Take one small step. 2. Change your mental maps. 3. Struggle is good. Scary is good. 4. Instant judgment is bad. 5. Remember the end of your life. 6. Be playful. 7. Be useful to others. 8. Perfectionism = procrastination. 9. Sleep, exercise, eat, chill out. Repeat. 10. Write it all down. 11. You can't get it all from reading. 
====
Gain self-confidence by learning how to play a new game
“If you want to make a change for the better or achieve a tough goal, don’t worry about motivation. Instead, focus on increasing your self-efficacy: confidence in your ability to solve your own problems and achieve your goals. The fastest and most reliable way to increase your self-efficacy is to learn how to play a new game. Any kind of game will do, because all games require you to learn new skills and tackle tough goals. The level of dopamine in your brain influences your ability to build self-efficacy. The more you have, the more determined you feel, and the less likely you are to give up. You’ll learn faster because high dopamine levels improve your attention and help you process feedback more effectively. Keep in mind that video games have been shown to boost dopamine levels as much as intravenous amphetamines. Whenever you want to boost your dopamine levels, play a game—or make a prediction.”
====
Depressive Realism: Depressed people have a more accurate view of the world because they’re more realistic about how risky and fragile life is. The opposite of “blissfully unaware.”
====
Skill Compensation: People who are exceptionally good at one thing tend to be exceptionally poor at another.
====
Curse of Knowledge: The inability to communicate your ideas because you wrongly assume others have the necessary background to understand what you’re talking about.
====
Base Rates: The success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try.
====
Base-Rate Neglect: Assuming the success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try doesn’t apply to you, caused by overestimating the extent to which you do things differently than everyone else.
====
Compassion Fade: People have more compassion for small groups of victims than larger groups, because the smaller the group the easier it is to identify individual victims.
====
System Justification Theory: Inefficient systems will be defended and maintained if they serve the needs of people who benefit from them – individual incentives can sustain systemic stupidity.
====
Three Men Make a Tiger: People will believe anything if enough people tell them it’s true. It comes from a Chinese proverb that if one person tells you there’s a tiger roaming around your neighborhood, you can assume they’re lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder. If three say it’s true, you’re convinced there’s a tiger in your neighborhood and you panic.
====
"Anyone who thinks they're too small to make a difference has never met the honeybee." - Popular saying, proverb, unknown attribution
====
Buridan’s Ass: A thirsty donkey is placed exactly midway between two pails of water. It dies because it can’t make a rational decision about which one to choose. A form of decision paralysis.
====
Pareto Principle: The majority of outcomes are driven by a minority of events.
====
Sturgeon’s Law: “90% of everything is crap.” The obvious inverse of the Pareto Principle, but hard to accept in practice.
====
Cumulative advantage: Social status snowballs in either direction because people like associating with successful people, so doors are opened for them, and avoid associating with unsuccessful people, for whom doors are closed.
====
Impostor Syndrome: Fear of being exposed as less talented than people think you are, often because talent is owed to cumulative advantage rather than actual effort or skill.
====
Anscombe’s Quartet: Four sets of numbers that look identical on paper (mean average, variance, correlation, etc.) but look completely different when graphed. Describes a situation where exact calculations don’t offer a good representation of how the world works.
====

====
Ringelmann Effect: Members of a group become lazier as the size of their group increases. Based on the assumption that “someone else is probably taking care of that.”
====
Semmelweis Reflex: Automatically rejecting evidence that contradicts your tribe’s established norms. Named after a Hungarian doctor who discovered that patients treated by doctors who wash their hands suffer fewer infections, but struggled to convince other doctors that his finding was true.
====
False-Consensus Effect: Overestimating how widely held your own beliefs are, caused by the difficulty of imagining the experiences of other people.
====
Boomerang Effect: Trying to persuade someone to do one thing can make them more likely to do the opposite, because the act of persuasion can feel like someone stealing your freedom and doing the opposite makes you feel like you’re taking your freedom back.
====
"Personal experience" can be a potent tool of persuasion. The listener gave considerably higher attention if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.
====
Chronological Snobbery: “The assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited. You must find why it went out of date. Was it ever refuted (and if so by whom, where, and how conclusively) or did it merely die away as fashions do? If the latter, this tells us nothing about its truth or falsehood. From seeing this, one passes to the realization that our own age is also ‘a period,’ and certainly has, like all periods, its own characteristic illusions.” – C.S. Lewis
====
Planck’s Principle: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
====
McNamara Fallacy: A belief that rational decisions can be made with quantitative measures alone, when in fact the things you can’t measure are often the most consequential. Named after Defense Secretary McNamara, who tried to quantify every aspect of the Vietnam War.
====
Courtesy Bias: Giving opinions that are likely to offend people the least, rather than what you actually believe.
====
Berkson’s Paradox: Strong correlations can fall apart when combined with a larger population. Among hospital patients, motorcycle crash victims wearing helmets are more likely to be seriously injured than those not wearing helmets. But that’s because most crash victims saved by helmets did not need to become hospital patients, and those without helmets are more likely to die before becoming a hospital patient.
====
Group Attribution Error: Incorrectly assuming that the views of a group member reflect those of the whole group.
====
Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon: Noticing an idea everywhere you look as soon as it’s brought to your attention in a way that makes you overestimate its prevalence.
====
Ludic Fallacy: Falsely associated simulations with real life. Nassim Taleb: “Organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win the gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life.”
====
Normalcy Bias: Underestimating the odds of disaster because it’s comforting to assume things will keep functioning the way they’ve always functioned.
====
“It's a lot easier than you think to 'beat the odds' because the odds are based on average people. Show up and elevate.” - Dr. Julie Gurner 
====
Actor-Observer Asymmetry: We judge others based solely on their actions, but when judging ourselves we have an internal dialogue that justifies our mistakes and bad decisions.
====
The 90-9-1 Rule: In social media networks, 90% of users just read content, 9% of users contribute a little content, and 1% of users contribute almost all the content. Gives a false impression of what ideas are popular or “average.”
====
Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy: Goals set retroactively after an activity, like shooting a blank wall and then drawing a bullseye around the holes you left, or picking a benchmark after you’ve invested.
====
The walls you put up to protect yourself work to imprison you.
====
Fredkin’s Paradox: Confronted with two equally good options, you struggle to decide, even though your decision doesn’t matter because both options are equally good. The more equal the options, the harder the decision.
====
Poisoning the Well: Presenting irrelevant adverse information about someone in a way that makes everything else that person says seem untrustworthy. “Before you hear my opponent’s healthcare plan, let me remind you that he got a DUI in college.”
====
Golem Effect: Performance declines when supervisors/teachers have low expectations of your abilities.
====
Appeal to Consequences: Arguing that a hypothesis must be true (or false) because the outcome is something you like (or dislike). The classic example is arguing that climate change isn’t real because combating climate change will hurt the economy.
====
Plain Folks Fallacy: People of authority acquiring trust by presenting themselves as Average Joe’s, when in fact their authority proves they are different from everyone else.
====
Behavioral Inevitability: “History never repeats itself; man always does.” – Voltaire
====
"Life is bristling with thorns, and I know no other remedy than to cultivate one's garden." - Voltaire
====
Apophenia: A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works.
====
Self-Handicapping: Avoiding effort because you don’t want to deal with the emotional pain of that effort failing.
====
Hanlon’s Razor: “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.”
====
False Uniqueness Effect: Assuming your skills are unique when they’re not. Comes from conflating “I’m good at this” with “Others are bad at this.”
====
Annoyance is the only truly renewable resource known to man. - Adam Mastroianni
====
The Wadsworth Constant says that you can safely skip the first 30% of anything you see online. It was meant for YouTube videos, but it applies just as well to writing. Somehow, whenever I finish a draft, my first few paragraphs almost always contain ideas that were necessary for writing the rest of the piece, but that aren’t necessary for understanding it. It’s like I’m giving someone a tour of my hometown and I start by showing them all the dead ends. - Adam Mastroianni
====
Everyone has this dream of a frictionless existence; nobody seems to like it much when they get it. Infinity pools and bottomless margaritas are fine for a time, but eventually you start wishing the moles would pop back up again so you could hit ‘em with a mallet. - Adam Mastroianni
====
"They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night." - From Edgar Allan Poe's "Eleonora"
====
Hard-Easy Effect: Hard tasks promote overconfidence because the rewards are high and fun to dream about; easy tasks promote underconfidence because they’re boring and easy to put off.
====
Neglect of Probability: Arguing that Nate Silver was wrong when he said Hillary Clinton has a 70% chance of winning, and using Donald Trump’s victory as your proof. Good predictions are based on probabilities, but the assessment of predictions are always binary, right or wrong.
====
Cobra Effect: Attempting to solve a problem makes that problem worse. Comes from an Indian story about a city infested with snakes offering a bounty for every dead cobra, which caused entrepreneurs to start breeding cobras for slaughter.
====
Braess’s Paradox: Adding more roads can make traffic worse because new shortcuts become popular and overcrowded.
====
Non-Ergodic: When group probabilities don’t apply to singular events. If 100 people play Russian Roulette once, the odds of dying might be, say, 10%. But if one person plays Russian Roulette 100 times, the odds are dying are practically 100%.
====
Pollyanna Principle: It’s easier to remember happy memories than bad ones.
====
Declinism: Perpetually viewing society as in decline, because you’re afflicted by the Pollyanna Principle and you forget how much things sucked in the past.
====
Empathy Gap: Underestimating how you’ll behave when you’re “hot” (angry/aroused/rushed), caused by the inability to accurately foresee how your body’s physical response to situations (dopamine, adrenaline, etc.) will influence decision-making.
====
Abilene Paradox: A group decides to do something that no one in the group wants to do because everyone mistakenly assumes they’re the only ones who object to the idea and they don’t want to rock the boat by speaking up.
====
Collective Narcissism: Exaggerating the importance and influence of your social group (country, industry, company, department, etc.).
====
Moral Luck: Praising someone for a good deed they didn’t have full control over. “Avoid calling heroes those who had no other choice.” – Taleb.
====
Feedback Loops: Falling stock prices scare people, which cause them to sell, which makes prices fall, which scares more people, which causes more people to sell, and so on. Works both ways.
====
Hawthorne Effect: Being watched/studied changes how people behave, making it difficult to conduct social studies that accurately reflect the real world.
====
Perfect Solution Fallacy: Comparing reality with an idealized alternative. Prevalent in any field governed by uncertainty.
====
Weasel Words: Phrases that appear to have meaning but convey nothing tangible. “Growth was solid last quarter,” or “Many people believe.”
====
Hormesis: Something that hurts you in a high dose can be good for you in small doses. (Weight on your bones, drinking red wine, etc.)
====
Backfiring Effect: A supercharged version of confirmation bias where being presented with evidence that goes against your beliefs makes you double down on your initial beliefs because you feel you’re being attacked.
====
Reflexivity: When cause and effect are the same. People think Tesla will sell a lot of cars, so Tesla stock goes up, which lets Tesla raise a bunch of new capital, which helps Tesla sell a lot of cars.
====
Second Half of the Chessboard: Put one grain of rice on the first chessboard square, two on the next, four on the next, then eight, then sixteen, etc, doubling the amount of rice on each square. When you’ve covered half the chessboard’s squares you’re dealing with an amount of rice that can fit in your lap; in the second half you quickly get to a pile that will consume an entire city. That’s how compounding works: slowly, then ferociously.
====
Peter Principle: Good workers will continue to be promoted until they end up in a role they’re bad at.
====
Friendship Paradox: On average, people have fewer friends than their friends have. Occurs because people with an abnormally high number of friends are more likely to be one of your friends. It’s a fundamental part of social network dynamics and makes most people feel less popular than they are.
====
Hedonic Treadmill: Expectations rise with results, so nothing feels as good as you’d imagine for as long as you’d expect.
====
Positive Illusions: Excessively rosy views about the decisions you’ve made to maintain self-esteem in a world where everyone makes bad decisions all the time.
====
Ironic Process Theory: Going out of your way to suppress thoughts makes those thoughts more prominent in your mind.
====
Clustering Illusions: Falsely assuming that the inevitable bunching of random results in a large sample indicates a trend.
====
Foundational Species: A single thing that plays an outsized role in supporting an ecosystem, whose loss would pull down many others with it. In nature: kelp, algae, and coral. In business: The Federal Reserve and Amazon.
====
You can mess up a lot of things in business and still do well as long as you get the big trend right. - Ludwig Jesselson
====
Bizarreness Effect: Crazy things are easier to remember than common things, providing a distorted sense of “normal.”
====
Nonlinearity: Outputs aren’t always proportional to inputs, so the world is a barrage of massive wins and horrible losses that surprise people.
====
Moderating Relationship: The correlation between two variables depends on a third, seemingly unrelated variable. The quality of a marriage may be dependent on a spouse’s work project that’s causing stress.
====
"A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person." - Mignon McLaughlin
====
Denomination Effect: One hundred $1 bills feels like less money than one $100 bill. Also explains stock splits – buying 10 shares for $10 each feels cheaper than one share for $100.
====
“I have never worshipped money and I never worked for money. I worked for pride and accomplishment. Money can become a nuisance. It's a hell of a lot more fun chasing it than getting it. The fun is in the race.” - Ray Kroc
====
Google Scholar Effect: Scientific research depends on citing other research, and the research that gets cited the most is whatever shows up in the top results of Google Scholar searches, regardless of its contribution to the field.
====
Inversion: Avoiding problems can be more important than scoring wins.
====
Gambler’s Ruin: Has many meanings, the most important of which is that playing a negative-probability game persistently enough guarantees going broke.
====
Principle of Least Effort: When seeking information, effort declines as soon as the minimum acceptable result is reached.
====
Dunning-Kruger Effect: Knowing the limits of your intelligence requires a certain level of intelligence, so some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are.
====
Knightian Uncertainty: Risk that can’t be measured; admitting that you don’t know what you don’t know.
====
Aumann’s Agreement Theorem: If you understand your opponent’s beliefs you cannot agree to disagree. If you agree to disagree it’s because one side doesn’t understand the other side’s view.
====
Focusing Effect: Overemphasizing factors that seem important but exist as part of a complex system. People from the Midwest assume Californians are happier because the weather is better, but they’re not because Californians also deal with traffic, bad bosses, unhappy marriages, etc, which more than offset the happiness boost from sunny skies.
====
The Middle Ground Fallacy: Falsely assuming that splitting the difference between two polar opposite views is a healthy compromise. If one person says vaccines cause autism and another person says they don’t, it’s not right to compromise and say vaccines sometimes cause autism.
====
Rebound Effect: New symptoms, or supercharged old symptoms, emerge when medicine or other protections are withdrawn.
====
Ostrich Effect: Avoiding negative information that might challenge views that you desperately want to be right.
====
Founder’s Syndrome: When a CEO is so emotionally invested in a company that they can’t effectively delegate decisions.
====
In-Group Favoritism: Giving preference to people from your social group regardless of their objective qualifications.
====
Bounded Rationality: People can’t be fully rational because your brain is a hormone machine, not an Excel spreadsheet.
====
Rationality requires a dialogue between heart and mind, blending analysis and intuition to chart a course through complexity.
Analytical types are prone to underestimate the importance of intuition, and creative types, the importance of rigorous analysis.
Both intuition and analysis are powerful tools with complementary strengths and weaknesses. It disadvantages you if you mainly rely on just one.
====
Luxury Paradox: The more expensive something is the less likely you are to use it, so the relationship between price and utility is an inverted U. Ferraris sit in garages; Hondas get driven.
====
Meat Paradox: Dogs are family, pigs are food. Some animals classified as food are wrongly perceived to have lower intelligence than those classified as pets. An example of morality depending on utility.
====
Fluency Heuristic: Ideas that can be explained simply are more likely to be believed than those that are complex, even if the simple-sounding ideas are nonsense. It occurs because ideas that are easy to grasp are hard to distinguish from ideas you’re familiar with.
====
Historical Wisdom: “The dead outnumber the living 14 to 1, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.” – Niall Ferguson
====
Fact-Check Scarcity Principle: This article is called 100 Little Ideas but there are fewer than 100 ideas. 99% of readers won’t notice because they’re not checking, and most of those who notice won’t say anything. Don’t believe everything you read.
====
Emotional Contagion: One person’s emotions trigger the same emotions in other people, because evolution has selected for empathizing with those in your social group whose actions you rely on.
====
Tribal Affiliation: Beliefs can be swayed by identity and a desire to fit in over rational analysis. There is little correlation between climate change denial and scientific literacy. But there is a strong correlation between climate change denial and political affiliation.
====
Emotional Competence: The ability to recognize others’ emotions and respond to them productively. Harder and rarer than it sounds.
====
https://fs.blog/the-metagame/
The metagame is this psychological game that exists among players, involving adjustments – adjustments based on how an opponent is likely to interpret a given set of actions. Better players adjust their strategies and styles to those of particular opponents, always analyzing how the opponents are playing in terms of how the opponents believe they’re playing. Maintaining a well-balanced strategy, while deciphering your opponents’ strategies, is the key to the metagame. If you comprehend the concept of the metagame, accurately perceive the flow of your table and then tournament, and stay alerted to and aware of current strategy trends, you’ll be able to successfully mix up your play when considering your image and that of your opponents. In return, your game will be highly unpredictable and difficult to read, which should be your ultimate goal.
====
Vacation won't make things better. Changing jobs won't make things better. Getting the recognition you deserve won't make things better. Drugs won't make things better. The only thing that will make things better is your relationship with yourself.
====
The very best don’t have to turn it on. It’s always on. They have to turn it off.
====
One way to become luckier is to show up consistently.
When people trust that you'll do what you say when you say it, not only will they want to work with you, but they'll want you to be successful. You can't build anything meaningful when you show up inconsistently.
In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are only as good as your consistency.

From "The Conquest of Happiness" by Bertrand Russell (1872-1972)

 Don’t take yourself so seriously
“One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is terribly important.”

 Don’t care too much about what others think of you
“One should as a rule respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny, and is likely to interfere with happiness in all kinds of ways.”

 Be without some of the things you want
“The man who acquires easily things for which he feels only a very moderate desire concludes that the attainment of desire does not bring happiness. If he is of a philosophic disposition, he concludes that human life is essentially wretched, since the man who has all he wants is still unhappy. He forgets that to be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.”

 Follow this two-step guide to happiness
“The secret of happiness is very simply this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.”

The Everyday Benefit of Philosophy Is That It Helps You Live with Uncertainty - Bertrand Russell

If you wait until you're motivated, you’ve already lost.
If you let motivation dictate your actions, inertia conspires to keep you in place.
Action creates progress. Progress creates momentum. Momentum creates motivation.

Doing your best isn’t about the result. It’s about the preparation. It’s about the position you find yourself in before you do whatever you are doing.
When you put yourself in the proper position, the result takes care of itself.

“The liberal democracy is an artificial environment, carefully crafted to both contain human nature and convert it into an engine of progress. When we grow up within an artificial habitat that values human inventions like reason and fairness and humanity, it can be easy to forget just how tenuous that environment is. It’s easy to forget that we’re living in a rare anomaly within human history—an anomaly held up only by trust, cultural norms, and shared assumptions. It’s easy to become overconfident in the stability and permanence of that environment and forget that the worst of human nature is always lurking just beneath the surface. But the reality is that a liberal democracy is a human construct, held in place not only by laws but by the “support beam” of liberal norms—shared notions of what is and isn’t tolerable or harmful and by shared determination to uphold those standards. When that support beam weakens, the environment can quickly collapse.”
— Tim Urban in What's Our Problem

Good thinking is expensive. Bad thinking costs a fortune.
One way to force yourself to think is to write. Good writing requires good thinking.
Forcing yourself to make your thinking visible gives poor thinking nowhere to hide. You can’t simply take a few minutes here and there, get the gist of the problem, and expect to have clear writing. It doesn’t work that way.
Good writing, like good thinking, takes time.

How to break a habit
“Any habit needs all its parts in order to function. If some parts are missing, the habit is disassembled.” - Carlos Castaneda
This short insight on the structure of a habit has helped me see my patterns differently. If there is something I want to stop doing, I just remove a “part” or step from the process. Lately, it’s been deleting apps and keeping my phone as far away from me as possible so that using it becomes an inconvenience. - CD

0 - ref. https://fs.blog/brain-food/november-6-2022/
Nature offers a great example with bamboo, which takes ups up to 5 years to develop its roots. For years, to the outside observer, no visible progress has been made. Meanwhile, the bamboo grows below the surface, developing its roots and storing energy. Then, all at once, it starts to grow. Years of stored energy result in exponential growth, sometimes reaching over 50 feet in a matter of weeks.
That’s how results happen. Slowly and then all at once.
Everyone wants the results. No one wants the process that leads to them. That's boring.

There are two main lessons to take away:
Not all progress is visible. Don’t beat yourself up when things aren’t visible. One workout won't make you fit, but it is better than no workout. A small deposit in your bank account today won’t get you to your goal, but it moves you closer. The daily grind is part of the process.
Consistently doing boring things well leads to extreme outperformance. Most of the time, we know what we need to do. The problem is because we don't immediately see the results, we stop. It's as if we tell ourselves, "I ate healthily and went to the gym all week, and I'm still not as fit as I want, so what's the point?"
You have to be smart enough to know you're making progress without any obvious signs of progress.

There are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.
The moment before letting go is often when we grip the hardest.
There is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn’t come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.
The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.
Your mind doesn’t wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what's in front of you.
You cannot practice non-attachment. You can only show your mind the suffering that attachment creates. When it sees this clearly, it will let go.
Monks love to fart while they meditate. The wisdom of letting go expresses itself in many forms.

====
10. The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.
====
11. An interesting thing happens when you start to like yourself. You no longer need all the things you thought you needed to be happy.
====
12. If you don’t train your mind to appreciate what is good,  you’ll continue to look for something better in the future, even when things are great.
====
13. The belief that there is some future moment more worth our presence than the one we’re in right now is why we miss our lives.
====
14. There is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn’t come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.
====
15. Spend more time cultivating a mind that is not attached to material things than time spent accumulating them.
====
16. Sometimes we need to get out of alignment with the rest of the world to get back into alignment with ourselves.
====
17. Real confidence looks like humility. You no longer need to advertise your value because it comes from a place that does not require the validation of others.
====
18. High pain tolerance is a double-edged sword. It’s key for self-control, but can cause us to override the pain of being out of alignment.
====
19. Negative thoughts will not manifest a negative life. But unconscious negative thoughts will.
====
20. To feel more joy, open to your pain.
====
21. Bullying yourself into enlightenment does not work. Befriending yourself is how you transcend yourself.
====
22. Peak experiences are fun, but you always have to come back. Learning to appreciate ordinary moments is the key to a fulfilling life.
====
23. Meditation is not about feeling good. It’s about feeling what you’re feeling with good awareness. Plot twist: Eventually that makes you feel good.
====
24. If you are able to watch your mind think, it means who you are is bigger than your thoughts.
====
25. Practicing stillness is not about privileging stillness over movement. It’s about the CAPACITY to be still amidst your impulses. It’s about choice.
====
26. The issue is not that we get distracted. It's that we're so distracted by distractions we don't even know we're distracted.
====
27. There are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.
====
28. Life is always happening in just one moment. That's all you're responsible for.
====
29. Your mind doesn’t wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what's in front of you.

====
32. Meditation can quickly become spiritualized suppression. Be careful not to use concentration to avoid what is uncomfortable.
====
33. One of the deepest forms of peace we can experience is living in integrity. You can lie to other people about who you are, but you can’t lie to your heart.
====
“Every time you’re tempted to slack off or do or be a little less than you could, remember that you are a person of integrity who lives by the simple creed: do what you said you would do, when you said you would do it, the way you said you would do it.” - Larry Winget

3. The Grey Rock Method:
Reacting emotionally to trolls and other toxic people only gives them what they want—your time & energy—which encourages further trolling & abuse. As such, the best way to get them to stop is to become unresponsive to their provocations.
====
5. Zeigarnik Effect:
Our brains are goal-focused, so we have better recall of unfinished tasks than finished ones. Exploit this by taking your breaks halfway through tasks. If you write, end the day mid-sentence so that when you return you'll find it easier to get rolling again.
====
7. Howard Hughes Syndrome:
Everyone always lies to the powerful, to curry favor or avoid punishment. Hearing nothing but flattery causes the most powerful people to develop the most distorted views of reality, and their vast influence means we all pay the price.
====
8. False Consensus Effect:
We assume everyone is like us, so our beliefs about others are derived from our knowledge of ourselves. Predictions of others' behavior often tell us more about the predictor, and accusations often tell us more about the accuser.
====
14. Rolestorming:
Having trouble being creative? Then pretend you're someone else, maybe Winston Churchill, or Lady Gaga, or Yoda. Continue to do your work while roleplaying as that person, imagining how they'd do your job. Enable you to think outside the box, this will.
====
19. Nominal Fallacy:
We label things to avoid having to think about them. For example, calling a murderer "evil" to explain their behavior absolves us of the need to confront the complex web of circumstances that led them to murder.
====
20. Ad Hoc Rescue:
We grow so attached to our beliefs that we begin to defend them like lawyers defending clients, using every trick we can to find loopholes that'll allow us to keep believing. As 55@PTetlock said: "Beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded."
====
24. The Never-Ending Now:
We're forever chasing what's new, ignoring anything older than 24 hrs, such as the accumulated wisdom of human history. We think the best info is the most recent, but often it's the oldest, because this has withstood the test of time.
====
26. Maslow's Hammer:
People disproportionately rely on what they understand to explain what they don't, so beware of the intellectual who's just published a new book, as they'll try to apply the book's ideas to *everything*.
====
27. Naval's Razor:
If you can't decide between 2 choices, take the path that's more difficult/painful in the short term. 
Doing this will counteract "hyperbolic discounting," the brain's tendency to overestimate short term pain and underestimate long term pain.
====
28. Okrent's Law:
We all know how biased journalists can be, but even those who attempt to be objective can spread misinformation, because the attempt to be even-handed often leads journalists to treat wrong opinions with more respect than they deserve.
====
29. Popper’s Falsifiability Principle:
For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it. As such, for each of your beliefs you should have a clear idea of what would persuade you you're wrong, otherwise your belief is immune to reason.

1. Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon:
When we notice something new, like an unusual word, we start seeing it more often. It feels like it's become more common but really we're just more alert to it, and we confuse our attention with reality itself. Hence conspiracy theories.
====
2. Ostrich Effect:
We often try to avoid info that we fear will cause us stress. Thus bills and work emails remain unopened, bank balances remain unchecked. This is counterproductive because ignoring a problem doesn't eliminate the problem or your anxiety; it only prolongs them.
====
3. Nobel Disease:
We idolize those who excel in a particular field, inflating their egos and afflicting them with the hubris to opine on matters they know little about. By celebrating people for their intelligence, we make them stupid.
====
4. Warnock's Dilemma:
Online content that provokes people gets more engagement than content people merely agree with, which incentivizes content creators to be provocative.
So much is alarming and enraging only because so much is trying to get your attention.
====
5. Google Scholar Effect:
We all get our answers from whatever tops the search results, so these results come to dominate a topic, muscling out unluckier viewpoints. Google has trapped us in an orgy of intellectual incest where everyone is drawing from the same tiny meme-pool.
====
6. Paradox Of Unanimity:
Researchers Gunn et al. (2016) found that when eyewitnesses unanimously agreed on the identity of suspects, they were more likely to be wrong.
The more people agree, the less likely they are thinking for themselves.
Therefore, beware of consensuses.
7. Epistemic Humility:
Instead of trying to be right, try to be less wrong. Avoiding idiocy is easier than achieving genius, and by beginning from the position that you don't know enough (which you don't), you'll gain more awareness of your blindspots and become harder to fool.
====
8. Mimetic Desire:
Craving is contagious; watching other people want a thing makes us want it too. It's why ads are so effective. But it puts us all into unnecessary competition as we fool ourselves into chasing what others are chasing simply because they are chasing it.
====
9. Overblown Implications Effect
“We think people judge us by a single success or failure, but they don’t. If you mess up one meal no one thinks you're a bad chef, and if you have one great idea no one thinks you're a genius. People just aren't thinking about you that much.”
- Ethan Mollick
====
10. Ellsberg Paradox:
People prefer a clear risk over an unclear one, even if it's no safer. E.g. They'd rather bet on a ball picked from a mix of 50 red & 50 black balls than on one where the exact ratio of red to black balls is unknown. Helps explain market volatility.
====
11. Veblen Goods:
We often attach value to things simply because they're hard to get. People will be more attracted to a painting if it costs $3 million than if it costs $3. The price becomes a feature of the product in that it allows the buyer to signal affluence to others.
====
12. Peter Principle:
People in a hierarchy such as a business or government will be promoted until they suck at their jobs, at which point they will remain where they are. As a result, the world is filled with people who suck at their jobs.
====
13. Meme Theory:
An ideology parasitizes the mind, changing the host’s behavior so they spread it to other people. Therefore, a successful ideology (the only kind we hear about) is not configured to be true; it is configured only to be easily transmitted and easily believed.
====
14. Gambler's Fallacy:
We often feel we're owed luck for being unlucky. "The coin was heads 10 flips in a row, the next flip has gotta be tails!" But probability has no memory; it won't make amends for its past behavior. Therefore, treat every possibility independent of the past.
====
15. Do Something Principle:
We often procrastinate because we're intimidated by our task. So make your task less intimidating by dividing it into steps and focusing only on the next step. Action creates traction, so each step you take will facilitate the next.
====
16. Lindy Effect:
The longer a non-biological system has existed, the longer it's likely to exist, because its age demonstrates its ability to weather the fickleness of fashions and the erosion of eons.
====
17. The Liar's Dividend:
Teaching people about deepfakes and other disinfo doesn't make them skeptical of falsehoods as much as it makes them skeptical of reality. Amid such confusion, they default to believing what they want to, discounting anything they don't like as disinfo.
====
18. Shibboleth:
An absurd ideological belief is a form of tribal signaling. It signifies that one considers their ideology more important than truth, reason, or sanity. To one's allies, this is an oath of unwavering loyalty. To one's enemies, it is a threat display.
====
19. The Potato Paradox:
Alice has 100kg of potatoes, which are 99% water. She lets them dry till they are 98% water. What is their new weight?
50kg.
Sound crazy? A reminder that the truth is often counterintuitive.
====
20. Throat-Clearing:
Before criticizing their own tribe, people feel the need to reaffirm their loyalty to the tribe. "I support X but..."
They do this because other people cannot comprehend that someone could see flaws in anyone other than the enemy team.
====
21. Law of Triviality:
A company needs a nuclear reactor and a bike shed. Few workers understand reactors, but all understand sheds, so the shed becomes the focus of debate as everyone tries to enact their vision.
Projects that require the least attention tend to get the most.
====
22. Chilling Effect:
When punishment for what people say becomes widespread, people stop saying what they really think and instead say whatever is needed to thrive in the social environment. Thus, limits on speech become limits on sincerity.
====
23. Reiteration Effect:
Joseph Goebbels said*, "Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth," and he was right; repetition can make people believe things they otherwise wouldn't.
*Goebbels didn't actually say this, but everyone thinks he did because of the Reiteration Effect.
24. Naïve Realism:
====
We know others are biased, but think we see the world as it is. Thus, teaching people about biases & fallacies doesn't make them doubt their own beliefs, it only makes them even more doubtful of their opponents'.
Maybe posting this megathread was a mistake...
====
25. Purity Spiral:
Members of political tribes inevitably begin competing with their fellows to be the most ideologically pure. The constant one-upmanship toward moral superiority causes the whole group to gradually become more extreme. E.g. Maoist China, Twitter echo-chambers.
====
26. Kayfabrication:
Politics is pro-wrestling in suits. Opposing parties are collaborators in a greater system, whose choreographed conflict entertains and distracts us from what is really going on.
====
27. Postjournalism:
The press lost its monopoly on news when the internet democratized info. To save its business model, it pivoted from journalism into tribalism. The new role of the press is not to inform its readers but to confirm what they already believe.
====
28. Curiosity Zone:
Curiosity is the desire to fill gaps in knowledge. Thus, curiosity occurs not when you know nothing about something, but when you know a bit about it. So learn a little about as much as you can (like you're doing now!), and it will spur you to learn even more.
====
29. Sorites Paradox:
What's the minimum number of grains of sand needed to make a heap? We don't know, because human language (in this case the word "heap") is imprecise. If our language can't even quantify a heap, how can it resolve the complex questions we so fiercely debate?
====
30: Brandolini's Law (aka the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle):
It takes a lot more energy to refute bullshit than to produce it. Hence, the world is full of unrefuted bullshit.
====
31. Algorithmic Blindspots:
We find growth while searching for other things. Algorithms give us exactly what we want on demand, so we never need to search, and never find what we never knew we needed.
If you wish to grow, defy the robots' recommendations.
====
32. Longtermism:
a) Future people matter morally as much as people alive now.
b) There are likely many more future people than people alive now.
c) Small changes now can have huge repercussions in future.
If these are true, should we be doing more for future generations?
====
33. The Two-Minute Rule:
If a task would take less than two minutes, do it immediately. This is because adding the task to your mental to-do list, keeping it in your memory, and managing the anxiety of not having done it will take far more effort than just doing it now.
====
34. Promethean Gap:
Technology is outpacing wisdom; we're changing the world faster than we can adapt to it. Lagging ever more behind accelerating progress, we're increasingly unable to foresee the effects of what we create. We're amassing the power of gods, yet we remain apes.
====
35. Information-Action Ratio:
The mark of useful info is that it makes us act differently. Most info we consume doesn't make us act differently; we just passively graze on it like cattle before defecating it undigested.
Stop mindless scrolling and seek out info that changes you.
====
36. Gurwinder's Third Paradox:
In order for you to beat someone in a debate, your opponent needs to realize they've lost. Therefore, it's easier to win an argument against a genius than an idiot.
====
37. Media Naturalness Theory:
Writing has existed for <2% of human history, so our brains are not evolved for reading; we need vocal/facial cues for context. Thus, accept that you'll be misunderstood online, but never stop posting, for the only way to write clearer is by writing.
====
38. Tilting At Windmills:
An online stranger doesn't know you; all they have are a few vague impressions of you, too meager to form anything but a phantasm. So when they attack "you", they're really just attacking their own imagination, and there is no need to take it personally.
====
39. Principle Of Humanity:
Every single person is exactly what you would be if you were them. This includes your political opponents. So instead of dismissing them as evil or stupid, maybe seek to understand the circumstances that led them to their conclusions.
====
40. Empty Name:
We can be convinced that a concept is real by the mere fact that it has a name, but the world is full of names for things that aren't real (e.g. Batman). As such, assume nothing is true just because it has a name (including every concept in this megathread!)
====
Gerald G. Jampolsky on accepting:
"Not judging is another way of letting go of fear and experiencing love. When we learn not to judge others – and totally accept them, and not want to change them – we can simultaneously learn to accept ourselves."
====
Farnam Street
The source of problems is blindspots. There is something hidden from us that, if we knew, would change how we thought and acted. One of the best ways to reveal blindspots is simply to lengthen your time horizon. A lot of good advice simply boils down to thinking longer term.
====
Book Freak
"If you want to create something worthwhile with your life, you need to draw a line between the world’s demands and your own ambitions."
====
Book Freak
"We tend to overestimate what we can do in a short period, and underestimate what we can do over a long period, provided we work slowly and consistently."
====
Book Freak
"If you’re like me, you have far too many things you want to do, read, see, test, and experience. Your inbox is a treasure trove of possibilities. To a creative mind, that’s very enticing. It’s easy for an optimist to keep fifty, a hundred, or even a thousand e-mails hovering in their inbox in the hopes that, someday soon, they’ll get a chance to give each opportunity the precious time that it deserves. But guess what? That’s never gonna happen."
====
Book Freak
Focus on prompting curiosity in your audience instead of solely conveying information
“To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from ‘What information do I need to convey?’ to "What questions do I want my audience to ask?”
====
Book Freak
Highlight the uncommon aspects of your message to ensure retention
“If I already intuitively ‘get’ what you're trying to tell me, why should I obsess about remembering it? The danger, of course, is that what sounds like common sense often isn't. It's your job, as a communicator, to expose the parts of your message that are uncommon sense.”
====
Book Freak
Embrace the unexpected journey to create a sense of mystery and engagement
“Mystery is created not from an unexpected moment but from an unexpected journey. We know where we’re headed—we want to solve the mystery—but we’re not sure how we’ll get there.”
====
Book Freak
Use storytelling to involve your audience
“The way you deliver a message to them is a cue to how they should react. If you make an argument, you’re implicitly asking them to evaluate your argument—judge it, debate it, criticize it - and then argue back, at least in their minds. But with a story, Denning argues, you engage the audience - you are involving people with the idea, asking them to participate with you.”
====
A good storyteller with a decent idea will always have more influence than someone with a great idea who hopes the facts will speak for themselves. 
====
“When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.” - Baltasar Gracián
====
https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/40-mind-expanding-concepts-spring
1. Dysrationalia:
Just because someone is intelligent, doesn’t mean their intelligence is pursuing intelligent goals. It’s possible to devote a genius-level intelligence to justifying idiotic opinions and behaviors. Tragically, a common fate of intellectuals.
====
2. Opinion Shopping:
Many who conduct research online ignore every source they disagree with till they find one they agree with, and then use this source as an authority to justify what they already believe. They don’t consider someone an expert unless they agree with them.
====
3. Grice’s Razor (aka Principle of Charity):
Most people are bad at expressing themselves, so don’t interpret their words literally, but rather by what they are most likely to mean. What they are most likely to mean is whatever the best possible interpretation of their words is.
====
4. The Opinion Pageant:
The rise of social media as the primary mode of interaction has caused us to overvalue opinions as a gauge of character. We are now defined more by what we say than what we actually do, and words, unlike deeds, are cheap and easy to counterfeit.
====
5. Godwin’s Law:
As an online discussion grows, the probability of a comparison to Nazis or Hitler approaches 100%.
Many people are quick to compare things to Nazi Germany because it’s the only history they know.
====
6. Limbic Capitalism:
Capitalism needs us to keep buying, and the best way to keep us buying is to get us addicted—to food, drugs, porn, news. Our brains are being violently overstimulated as businesses compete to obsess us; the market is slowly turning us into mindless dopamine-junkies.
====
7. Audience Capture:
Nikocado wanted to blow up online, so he did what got him the most views: eating all he could. He certainly blew up, but not as intended, finding fame as a grotesque caricature of himself. Self-caricaturization awaits any influencer who seeks engagement at all costs.
====
8. Ragebait:
The easily outraged are easily manipulated. If you can’t control your emotions, other people will.
Prevent the puppeteering of your passions by postponing your reactions; if a post enrages you, pause, and consider if it was created specifically to enrage you.
====
9. Deferred Happiness Syndrome:
The common feeling that your life hasn't begun, that your present reality is a mere prelude to some idyllic future. This idyll is a mirage that'll fade as you approach, revealing that the prelude you rushed through was in fact the one to your death.
====
10. Path Dependence:
The QWERTY keyboard layout was a misguided attempt to stop typewriters jamming, but, despite being inefficient for typing, it’s endured into the digital age, because we all just accepted it as the norm.
We become blind to so many problems because we let them become part of life.
====
11. Golden Mean:
Good character is not about maximizing virtues but moderating them: to be sensitive without being fragile, confident without being cocky, steadfast without being stubborn, driven without being reckless, focused without being obsessed.
====
12. Danth’s Law:
If you have to insist that you've won an argument, you've probably lost badly. This is because insisting that you won is a sign of rampant ego, and ego is the greatest obstacle to reason.
====
13. Idiocy Saturation:
Online, people who don't think before they post are able to post more often than people who do. As a result, the average social media post is stupider than the average social media user. Worth remembering whenever online dumbassery drives you to despair.
====
14. Weber–Fechner Law:
Each bottom square contains 10 more dots than the one above. This is noticeable when the dots are few (left) but not when they're many (right). This blindspot is why you don’t care about saving $100 when buying a house but you do when buying a shirt.
====
15. Scoreboard Principle:
Metrics motivate. Quantifying your progress on a task will push you to work harder, as it’ll become like a game in which you’re trying to increase your score. Find ways to number your progress, and you’ll become determined to make the numbers grow.
====
16. Bandwidth Tax:
Being poor is expensive; constantly managing scarce resources requires such mental effort (intellectual and emotional) that there’s little brainpower left for anything else. Thus, poverty makes it hard to escape poverty.
====
17. Bullshit Jobs (actual name):
Most modern jobs are meaningless, with the majority of labor yielding no tangible real-world impact. The aimlessness of work leaves people unfulfilled, and, since one’s job is considered one’s identity, it also costs them their self-worth.
====
18. Anna Karenina Principle:
There are many ways to be wrong but only one way to be right. As such, truth is fragile; a minor accident can make it false. But lies are tough; they seldom accidentally become true. Truth is therefore highly perishable and must be actively preserved.
====
19. Shaker's Law:
Those who announce their departure from an online discussion almost never actually leave.
====
20. Pretty Privilege:
Beautiful people are generally treated much better by society than people who are simply white or male, yet activists raucously attack white privilege and male privilege while ignoring pretty privilege, making them guilty of pretty privilege privilege.
====
21. Purposeful Stupidity:
In 1944, the OSS (now known as the CIA) published a field manual laying out strategies to stealthily sabotage a society from within. The tactics described are eerily similar to what passes for normality today.
====
22. Deep Time:
Cleopatra lived closer in time to the creation of Twitter than to the creation of the Great Pyramid. The T-Rex lived closer in time to us than to the Stegosaurus. These facts are counterintuitive because our puny minds cannot grasp the vastness of geologic time.
====
23. Longevity Risk:
Most people don’t prepare for the possibility that they may live a long time and spend many years being unable to adequately take care of themselves. They undersave money, fail to arrange for their own care, etc. Don’t worry about dying, worry about living!
====
24. Oppression Olympics:
Social media is a war for public sympathy, so victimhood is a status symbol that many compete for by collecting injuries real & imagined, often goading others into attacking them so they can screenshot/record it and thereby immortalize their prestigious oppression.
====
25. Tarzwell's Razor:
Emotion is an indicator of bias. The more emotional you feel, the less you should trust your judgment. Awkwardly, people are most motivated to tweet when emotional, meaning people pass judgment most when their judgment can be trusted least.
====
26. Dark Forest Theory:
The Fermi paradox suggests the galaxy should be teeming with aliens, yet there’s no sign of any. It may be that any civilization that makes too much noise gets discovered & destroyed by a galactic predator. Curiously, our civilization is getting louder...
====
27. Presentism:
We judge history by modern standards. We regard slave-owners as evil, but slavery was so common & familiar to our forebears that they were blind to its iniquities, as we are to the industrial slaughter of animals (for which we too will eventually be called evil.)
====
28. Cylindrical Perspective:
From one angle, the shape is a circle. From another, it’s a square. People on either side argue over the true shape, each convinced that the other is wrong, because social media rewards us for arguing in 2D about 3D issues.
====
29. Teletransportation Paradox:
Someone creates a perfect replica of you, identical down to every atom. Would you suddenly inhabit 2 consciousnesses, simultaneously seeing through 2 pairs of eyes, or would the clone be someone else altogether? Either possibility is bizarre.
====
30. Firehosing:
In the past, the purpose of disinformation was to convince you of a single narrative. In the digital age, the purpose of disinfo is to overwhelm you with many contradictory narratives until you start to doubt everything and become confused, demoralized & passive.
====
31. The Fourth Turning (aka Strauss-Howe generational theory):
The idea that history is not linear but helical, because civilization has its own seasons. As the famous quote by G. Michael Hopf goes:
“Hard times create strong men,
Strong men create good times,
Good times create weak men,
Weak men create hard times.”
====
32. Enthymeme:
The best propagandists convince people of a lie not by stating the lie directly but by making statements that tacitly assume the lie as a premise. A mistruth deduced in one's own mind is much harder to guard against than one that enters fully formed from elsewhere.
====
33. Purva Paksha:
To truly understand an opposing view, try to argue in favor of it as best you can. This will prevent your tribal brain from reflexively dismissing it as an “enemy ideology”, and force you to genuinely consider its merits.
====
34. Arrival Fallacy:
We didn't evolve to be happy, but to believe we'll be happy if we just accomplish the latest goal. So we seldom taste true joy, but we often pick up its scent—just enough to keep us in pursuit. Paradise is not a destination, or even a journey, but a horizon.
====
35. Law of Accelerating Returns:
For 300,000 years, humans didn’t have computers. Then, in less than a century, we invented PCs, the web, smartphones, and generative AI. New discoveries facilitate newer discoveries, so technological progress is not linear but exponential.
====
36. Russell's Teapot:
Believing things because they haven't been disproven is madness, as it would require believing there’s a teapot orbiting the moon. Eliminate Russell’s Teapot with Hitchens’ Razor: “What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.”
====
37. Gurwinder's Defibrillator (to restart your heart when you’re out of empathy):
Everyone is an ape adrift in an alien world, born into a struggle they did not choose, bullied by impulses they cannot control, searching for answers they will not find, and condemned to a fate they do not deserve.
Go easy on them.
====
38. Focusing Illusion:
Focusing on an issue causes it to take up extra space in your head, making it seem bigger & badder than it actually is. In truth, almost nothing in life is as bad as your mind portrays it. As Seneca said, “We suffer more in imagination than in reality.”
====
39. The Spyglass Self:
We develop our identities by glimpsing ourselves through others' eyes, imagining how they see us, adjusting ourselves accordingly. Since personality is a performance in the limelight of another’s gaze, we cannot be someone without someone to be someone for.
====
40. Feynman’s Razor:
If you can’t explain something to a child, you don’t understand it yourself. This is because it's only when you fully grasp a topic that you can distill it down to its essence. I write these lists for anyone to understand, which helps me to understand.
====
[SahilBloom] https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1456969261839228936
The Feynman Technique to learn anything:

Step 1: Identify a topic.
Step 2: Try to explain it to a 5-year-old.
Step 3: Study to fill in knowledge gaps.
Step 4: Organize, convey, and review.

True genius is the ability to simplify, not complicate. Simple is beautiful.

====
“Passion is found in the present, while desire is focused on the future. When you desire a certain outcome, you are constantly judging whether that outcome will materialize or not. When you’re present, your focus is absolute in the moment.” - Jim Murphy
====
Skin in the Game
Skin in the Game means that the key principals participate in both the upside and downside associated with any decisions.
Always look for its presence in any new situation.
Avoid games where those making the rules don't have any skin in the game.
====
Trick your brain: “Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a ‘real’ experience.”
====
Hypnotize yourself in a positive way: “It is no exaggeration to say that every human being is hypnotized to some extent either by ideas he has uncritically accepted from others or ideas he has repeated to himself or convinced himself are true. These negative ideas have exactly the same effect upon our behavior as the negative ideas implanted into the mind of a hypnotized subject by a professional hypnotist.”
====
New problems constantly arise - get used to it: “Happiness is a mental habit, a mental attitude, and if it is not learned and practiced in the present it is never experienced. It cannot be made contingent upon solving some external problem. When one problem is solved, another appears to take its place. Life is a series of problems. If you are to be happy at all, you must be happy - period! Not happy ‘because of.’”
====
Learn from errors, don’t dwell on them: “Our errors, mistakes, failures, and sometimes even our humiliations, were necessary steps in the learning process. However, they were meant to be means to an end - and not an end in themselves. When they have served their purpose, they should be forgotten. If we consciously dwell on the error, or consciously feel guilty about the error and keep berating ourselves because of it, then - unwittingly - the error or failure itself becomes the "goal" that is consciously held in imagination and memory.”
====
“When it's over, I don't want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.” - Mary Oliver

The Weekend Test
"What the smartest people do on the weekend is is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years." - @cdixon
Observe the weekend projects of the smartest people in your circles.
Odds are those will become a key part of our future.
Invest accordingly.

The @paulg Crazy Idea Framework
If someone proposes a crazy idea, ask:
(1) Are they a domain expert?
(2) Do I know them to be reasonable?
If yes on both (1) and (2), you should take the idea seriously, as it may be an asymmetric bet on the future.

"What Will Stay the Same?" Framework
Jeff Bezos famously said that investing in what might change is risky, but investing in what will stay the same is safe.
The future is hard to predict, so looking for constants you can deliver against may provide a cleaner path to success.

3. Push past the awkwardness.
Awkwardness is not an excuse. It’s an opportunity. It’s a signal from your brain that you’re about to learn, grow, and experience something novel. So, talk to new people. Speak up in class. Try an unusual sport. Awkwardness is a paper tiger easily slayed.

4. When in doubt, ask the world’s most clarifying question.
Stuck on a decision? Ask yourself: “What would I tell my best friend to do?” Then do that.
====
5. Say “please” and “thank you” every day.
It sounds old-fashioned. And maybe it is. But these three words deliver an antidote to entitlement and carve a pathway to a richer life.

How do you give good advice about what to do? 
There’s a hierarchy of skill levels regarding what people do when someone comes to them for help solving a problem: 
 1. Reaction: suggest what first comes to your mind after the person tells you about their challenge.
 2. Personal anecdote: say what worked for you in a similar-sounding situation.
 3. Patterns: give advice about examples of what tends to work for others in similar-sounding situations. 
 4. Empathy and Patterns: listen closely and attentively, empathetically ask questions, and explain what you’ve seen work for others in a similar situation.
 5. Empathetic Analysis: empathetically ask questions, listen to their proposed options for what they might do, propose one to two other potential options, then discuss the most important advantages and disadvantages of all options.
 6. Model: empathetically ask questions until you have a causal model. Explain it to the person to see its weaknesses. Get their help improving it. Use it to predict a few things that may work, and discuss the pros and cons of each of them. Encourage the person to pick what to try first/second/etc.

“It’s true that becoming an empathic listener takes time, but it doesn’t take any-where near as much time as it takes to back up and correct misunderstandings when you’re already miles down the road, to redo, and to live with unexpressed and unsolved problems.” - Steven Covey

"There is no way around hard work. Embrace it." - Roger Federer
====
Most of the time, it’s not about having a gift. It’s about having grit. In tennis, like in life, discipline is also a talent. And so is patience.
Trusting yourself is a talent. Embracing the process—loving the process—is a talent. Managing your life, managing yourself.
These can be talents, too. Some people are born with them. Everybody has to work at them.” - Roger Federer
====
“Perfection is impossible. In the 1526 singles matches I played in my career, I won almost 80% of those matches. Now, I have a question for you.
What percentage of points do you think I won in those matches? Only 54%.
You teach yourself to think, okay, I double-faulted ... it's only a point. Okay, I came to the net, then I got passed again; it's only a point. Even a great shot, an overhead backhand smash that ends up on ESPN's top 10 playlist. That, too, is just a point.
And here's why I'm telling you this. When you're playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it's behind you, It's behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity, and focus.
You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments. That is, to me, the sign of a champion. The best in the world are not the best because they win every point. It's because they lose again and again and have learned how to deal with it. You accept it. Cry it out if you need to and force a smile.” - Roger Federer

“We must always remember that possessions have no inherent value. They become what we make them. If they increase our capacity to give, they become something good.

“Write early in the morning, cultivate memory, reread core books, take detailed reading notes, work on several projects at once, maintain a thick archive, rotate crops, take a weekly Sabbath, go to bed at the same time, exercise so hard you can’t think during it, talk to different kinds of people including the very young and very old, take words and their histories seriously (i.e., read dictionaries), step outside of the empire of the English language regularly, look for vocabulary from other fields, love the basic, keep your antennae tuned, and seek out contexts of understanding quickly (i.e., use guides, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia without guilt).” —John Durham Peters

Giving to others requires friendship with oneself - Salvatore Giammusso on Aristotle's Ethics
====
From philosophers to my PT urging me to care for my own health in order to be able to care for my family. Charity in its simplest form, care, must start with the self. The no-ego/no-free-will propaganda of today gets me feeling selfish at times. A feeling I’m learning to defuse contextually.

Yeah, that sucks – I'll be mad about it in another lif - Chill looking old dude in the community hot tub
====
Whatever the cards you get in life, there will always be struggle. Your choices won't change this fact. Many people find solace in realizing that humans have little control over their own fate. I prefer to focus on taking responsibility for how I feel about it to avoid throwing myself a pity-party. Feeling oppressed by some cosmic power is a dead end. Most of my pain comes from resisting this fact. 
====
Most wealth is inherited, not self-create - Thomas Piketty
====
This has been on top of my facts-that-irritate-me list for a while. Everyone sane knows that the current system is not truly a meritocracy. Facing this statistical reality can be a grounding or frustrating experience. As growth slows, past wealth naturally takes on a larger importance. It's harder for us today than it was for those before, and much harder for those who'll come after. I'll leave this here as a reminder for people like my mother-in-law and advice-leaking poolside boomers. 
====
The longer you delay that thing you know you should do, the more difficult it gets. The easier thing in the short run is often the harder thing in the long run. Pain today, gain tomorrow.
====
Frustration is bargaining with reality, hoping it will change.
Yelling at traffic doesn't make it move faster. Rehearsing the same complaints about your spouse doesn't change their behavior. Getting angry at the delayed flight doesn't make it take off sooner. While you're busy fighting what is, you're blind to what could be. All the energy you put into arguing with reality comes at the expense of improving your situation. The mountain doesn't care how much you yell at it, but you'll find a path around it if you stop and look.

The key to being a wonderful writer is not to write. You just get out of the way. Leave room for God to walk in the room - Micheal Jackson
====
Creative work relies on breakthroughs - eureka moments. Over the years I’ve developed an appreciation for the little control I have over how the breakthroughs happen. One can give himself a slight edge with a few hacks and rituals but in the end, it's never fully in our control. Appreciating the struggle of it all and creating the space allows one to elevate the creative act beyond oneself. I’m not big on god, nor making Art but I  sense little free will in my own process.

"The only people who see the whole picture are the ones who step outside the frame." - Salman Rushdie
====
“Most of us spend a lot of time censoring everything that we see and hear. Does it fit with our world picture? And if it doesn’t, how can we shut it out, how can we ignore it, how can we challenge it? We are continually threatened in life, it’s true. But once you are alone with a book, and it’s also true with a picture or with music, all those defenses drop and you can enter into a quite different space where you will learn to think differently about yourself.” - Jeanette Winterson ♥

The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time. - Mary Oliver

The outcomes are a byproduct of your process - Marc Hemeon
====
I'm a creature of habits with a massive struggle to find focus for the sake of making a thing. Partly because I don't have a strong sense of what I want to do with my 4000 weeks, but as Marc points out, I'm not convinced that having a sharply defined target is the best way to get anywhere. I have my quirks, my process of making stuff because it all goes somewhere- like these notes.

Everyone leaves the races at some point in their life, for different reasons. One day you die. You win the final race. I'm not in a rush to win this one. The fitness culture in the US leaves alien to the true pace and feel of the great outdoors. It's comical how it’s hard to find good cycling gear for truly recreational riding. The mild discomfort of times on the saddle is worth the space it gives the mind.

I'm not wise enough to hold the thought of the ephemeral nature of my life, so I have to surround myself of a few vanities - Sylvain Tesson
====
Ambiguity in a world of endless distraction distractions urges us to live faster, try all the things, in an attempt to reach something that appears elusive. I forget the philosophy often. Devices, often gimmicky, are the best reminders. I long for a beautifully examined life, sitting in a garden with the luxury of time to contemplate. That's unfortunately not the reality of most of my days so I need my silly watch.

Nothing is more peaceful than having no interest in a anyon - popular statement seen online
====
While the first read seems to indicate a desire to justify, perhaps even appreciate solitude rather than seek attention and romance, I hear something broader. Especially when replacing the term ‘anyone’ with ‘something’. I’m rarely at peace with rejecting something or someone, even when I have truly no interest. Saying no allows peace to be kept and judgment surrendered, ideally on both sides.

“Conversation enriches the understanding but solitude is the school of genius.” - Edward Gibbon

How are we going to get to get back up?… That’s a problem for a later-m - dad of 3 met at the bottom of a tall dune
====
A golden piece of dad knowledge. Sometimes letting go simply translates into postponing reaction. Dealing with things in the moment is tricky, most of our behaviors are responses. Delay is a sort of non-response, not necessarily nonchalant or lazy, and almost always a wiser choice. The idea is not to hope to forget or get away with it. It’s to reduce stress in the present moment while making space for a wiser answer. To touch a bit of that be-here-now feel. 
====
Incredible things materialize when you learn to let go - Zen / Buddhist formula
====
AI've come to define what feels like my consciousness as a state of (constant) mental strain. The momentary release of the strain, or enlightenment as Buddhists say, is a momentary awakening, calling for lifelong cultivation. The beginning of this process is to allow other people, things, and process, to have their own opinions; do their own thing. Without judgement. Basically letting go.

“I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive… so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” - Joseph Campbell
====
As someone often caught up in the torturous feelings of the creative process, I find some comfort in this zen-like statement. If the thing I’m chasing exists (goodness) it must be contingent on the existence of its opposite (mediocrity). Thus encountering mediocrity should be accepted as part of the process. That doesn’t make it easy, but somehow confirms forward motion. 
====
Have you seen the size of a donkeys hears? You don't need to whisper loud. They ear everything. They even ear your thoughts - Theo du Plessis
====
Babies, animals, rocks... all things that appears to not 'understand' the complexity of the world extend us an invitation to pure awareness. It's easy to see ignorance where there is only presence. A sense of wholeness that only the momentary cessation of thought and movement seem to enable. I'm not great at sitting still or not thinking, especially at the same time. 
====
We have gone so far as to define faith as intellectual conviction rather than living fully in a condition of limited knowledge - Thomas Moore on Thomas Merton
====
Partial knowledge is frustrating but what seems to be the most honest and accurate description of what this whole circus is about. Although I’ve not gotten much exposure to religious views on the matter I can now appreciate how they offer an elaborate coping mechanism. Most of the perceived differences are historical events and storytelling devices. I've defined for myself the concept of 'god' as: the contemplation that there is (not simply might) a particular something rather than an abstracted nothing. 
====
Frugality is not poverty but often looks very similar. Frugality is a deliberate behavior. Poverty is inflicted - Jean-Marc Jancovici
====
It's easy to feel oppressed by loss when something becomes unattainable. Basic and comfort are two different things. Food, water and shelter are all we really need. Abundant, cheap energy brought a lot of comfort into our existence. That's very recent and won't last. We can and will have to choose how we feel about it. 
====
There is at the bottom of a deep squat, or a good calf stretch, more healing than psychotherapy will ever bring to you - Rephrase of something overheard at the gym
====
When the body doesn’t feel good, we're not primed mentally. Exercise is medicine. From Hippocrate to the modern gym, our body is our temple. Mind and body are the same thing. Not hardware and software, but one beautifully complex organism with a sort of physical intuition that enables one to literally get in touch with it - To listen to what just is happening within and around... Fundamental perceptions with cathartic potential that medicine will only assist, but never provide. 
====
Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize until you have tried to make it precise - Bertrand Russell
====
I initially thought that lack of vocabulary was at the root of many of my frustrations. Exposure to Eastern concepts (to not say buddhism) have led me to believe that all things are just concepts, even the most defined philosophical or scientific fact. There is no way to accurately describe (let alone understand) the essence of a thing. And this doesn't mean that we should never try or talk. 
====
I can’t help wonder if the cost, monetary and otherwise, is really worth it just to be able put a number on how much one sucks at cycling - Mike Hayes
====
I go throught cycles of interest/hatred with tracking devices. From sleep, to exercies to food I tried most mainstream things for no real benefit other than momentary feeling of control and accountability that was not needed in the first place. Knowing the attention and emotional cost was just the first step, the cultural and ecological costs are crystalizing a even grimmer picture.

I don't have a solution. Just concerning thoughts. - Ana Rodrigues

I could (perhaps should) start most conversations on important topics with this statement.

How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. - Annie Dillard
====
I feel the reality of this statement almost every night as the day fade. Seeing life in a day has become something much more concrete than a poetic concept, mostly by becoming a father. 
====
Whatever one achieves by efforts directed at anti-aging, one still winds up older than the younger version of oneself. Even during the time spent in pursuit of anti-aging, we are…aging. The very time spent making the comparison widens the divide. - David L. Katz
====
Deep is the shame I accumulated because of some of my 20s self help and influencer based obsessions. Life is a blessing at any age. There is something clearly sisyphean in humanity anti-aging quest. 
====
Our modern skulls house a stone-age mind. - John Tooby and Leda Cosmides
====
In a society where basic survival needs are generally met, you may find yourself grappling with a void, a lack of a clear, driving purpose that your ancestors naturally had. Thus, your struggles are viewed as a mere lack of willpower, when the problems run much deeper. You spiral into a paralyzing indecision amidst a sea of seemingly endless opportunities and choices. Having unlimited paths can be as agonizing as having none. 
====
Willpower is overrated. Modern research challenges the idea that willpower is a limited resource. Believing in it too strongly can actually make self-control harder. Willpower is rooted in outdated moral ideas. Its origins lie in Victorian moralizing, and it still unfairly blames individuals for complex problems like addiction or poverty. Letting go of the willpower myth helps. Focusing on stress, emotions, and expectations can lead to real change, without obsessing over willpower.
====
Self-control is multifaceted. It involves emotion regulation, reframing, motivation, and managing internal conflicts. Just resisting urges isn’t enough.
====
Reframing works better than force. Changing how we view a problem often leads to better outcomes than trying to “push through” with effort alone.
====
Once you're out the door, it's always worth it - Lachlan Morton
====
Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose?” and “why should I exist?” lose their force upon lifestyle fixes (acts). In other words, being around people, going outside regularly and getting enough sleep can go a long way to solving existentialism.

Still simmering: I'm certainly guilty of opting for a quick opinion rather than getting evertyhing factually right - perhaps to a fault and definitely to the great displeasure of my wife. tere seem to be too few socratic truths to really uphold such a standard, yet I see the slope.

You are under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago. - Alan Watts

As I become a homeowner and get into the inevitable accumulation of stuff, I try very hard to remember that peace isn't a fancy house, better stuff or an exotic vacation. It's cultivated inside. 
====
A man went in search of fire with a lighted lantern. Had he known what fire was he could have cooked his rice much sooner. - Zen parable
====
Seeking satisfaction in others or in external objects or events reinforces a deep and often unacknowledged belief that we, as we are, are not entirely complete; that we need something beyond ourselves in order to experience a sense of wholeness or security or stability. 
====
Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him. - Aldous Huxley
====
An obvious fact of life that really stuck as I stumble upon it summarized this way, which perhaps illustrate even further the fact that I needed to experience it that way for it to finally register. 
====
The problem is no longer getting to express oneself but finding moments solitude and silence in which one might eventually find something worth saying. - Gille Deleuze
====
Technology claims to empower us to express ourselves easily. The ease is there, and has been for a long time. Too many options and a fetish for tools seems to separate us from our thoughts. There is those who abuse of this, diluting meaning in mass and those like me who struggle to even find the space to let thought occur. 
====
As technology advances, software will increasingly be chosen not just for how well it addresses its use case, but how it conveys its personality, similar to how we choose our clothes. - Molly Mielke
====
I spend a lot of time in my career in tech arguing to make things prettier. Our culture either worship beauty or rejects it. Software in most case is perceived as utilitarian only. I hope one day our culure will change its understanding of the unfortunate reality.Until then I'll pray for a return to the jungle while making 'pretty' pixels.

“big secret to happiness is just liking stuff. finding more stuff to like. finding ways to like stuff you didn’t before…” - Lauren Wilford
====
Priorities are like arms. If you think you have more than a couple, you're either lying or crazy. - from 'The Wisdom' by Merlin Mann
====
I heard many version of this. Counting 'fucks' seems to be a sign of the battle being already lost. Instead, I like how this focused on a direct comparison with what the body allows. With childcare I discovered a degree of fatigue that was unknown to me, forcing me not to redefine my priorities but to pick 2 and be okay with it. Because: calories. 
====
Be careful what you cast ou - the vacancy is quickly filled. - Austin Osman Spare
====
After year of interest in minimalism and thinking about how to navigate our consumerist society, this remain one of the hardest entropic force to overcome. Get rid of something is just the first step of the process, keeping the space free to reclaim clarity is the bulk of it. 
====
When I think too much, I fall on my face - Beau Miles
====
Overthinking has a been a problem of mine for long. like a lot of people, my problems is I think I have a problem. It’s really easy to tell ourselves how something is unfair until we realize we are the only one responsible for the happening of it. 
====
Don’t worry that children never listen to you; worry that they are always watching you. - Robert Fulghum
====
As honest as my rage and pessimism feel, I know its unhealthy character. The existential pressure of raising child is working against me in a good way. Of course it's not enough and surely not the socially praised way to deal with it. But it feels stronger than all the will power I've ever deployed. 
====
The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. - F. Scott Fitzgerald
====
There is so much complexity, ambiguity, paradoxe, and contradictions in life, it is oppressing. Staying functional while acknowledging each side of every idea is exhausting but seem to be a path to intellectual honesty. Nothing is all good or bad. Timing and context are everything. Do the mental effort. 
====
Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you. - Anne Lamott
====
If you ever need a mantra to convince you to take a break, this is a good one. I like to walk, since I can't just sit still... at least without earplugs. 
====
Where you stand, this bright corner of the universe, there is no one to enjoy it but you. - Sam Harris
====
It took me a while to emotioanlly acknowldge that a moment exist only because I live it right here, right now. The sense of urgency created by having a child rendered clear the crucial importance of living in the present, and the discipline which that it requires. 
====
It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows. - Epictetus
====
My ego supported by modern technology often makes me believe I've, or can figure things out, fairly easily. But some things like gardening or parenting, do not obey to classic ignorance &gt; knowledge &gt; solution pattern. It needs to be experienced to viscerally be discarded. 
====
There are rarely solutions, only tradeoffs. - Thomas Sowell
====
What a strangely fitting end to a life so very well lived - Josh about Socrates
====
His living voice and examined life have been dissected across ages but his death is really what gave it its legendary status. Few conversations can really get into the meat of socratic philosophy. Those who know anything of it usually appreciate the comment about his death as a great example of the Summum Bonum. 
====
Unless you are hunting for food or making a baby, there is no point to anything really - Beau Miles
====
Living the first moments with my own child made me quickly reflect on my relentless quest for meaning. The primal feel of seeing your own kid live is humbling. There seems to be no great purpose beyond being alive here, now. The sight of a baby allows to boil down life to it's very essence: Eating and procreating.

"Real wisdom is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of which things in life are necessary, which are less necessary, and which are completely unnecessary to know.

"We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers." - Carl Sagan
====
I think about how modern life has changed us. Often for the worse, contemplating the myth of the noble savage. There is an undeniable loss that occured over time. I'm unusure about the idea of a human nature, like a preset. But when I feel unfulfilled I sometime fantasised of a more primitive existence. 
====
I'm always one ride aways from figuring it all out - Tom Ritchey
====
"Hearts are the strongest when they beat in response to noble ideals." - Ralph Bunche
====
My thoughts rarely make sense when I ride my bike. It's always after getting off the saddle I really realize that and can get the second wave. The good stuff comes after. It reminds me that exercise is medicine and that the only thing that matters is here and now. On and off the saddle, on which I'll be back soon. 
====
After all these years, I have come to realise that I must go through a period of agony and torture before I have a breakthrough. - Hans Zimmer
====
Nothing good comes easy. The creative process is a torture that usually feels too personal. I like how zimmer puts in perspective the pain of the process that rarely get acknowldge in our hustle culture that want flow state and breakthoughts on demand.

“It’s easy to feel as if we’re standing two inches away from a huge canvas that’s noisy and crowded and changing with every microsecond. It’s only by stepping farther back and standing still that we can begin to see what that canvas (which is our life) really means, and to take in the larger picture.” - Pico Iyer
====
The dose makes the poison - Paracelsus
====
We've know about the idea of hormesis for a long time but seem to forget quite often that a bit os something bad for us can have positive effects. Too much comfort makes us weak; not enough can kill. Finding the limit is a perilous exercise of moderation. I try to apply this hormetic approach to nutrition, exercise and intelect as frequently as possible. 
====
The stronger a theory is, the easier it is in principle to find that it is false, and the more likely we are to believe it if we fail to do so. In contrast, a theory that is completely incapable of being disproved is often described as ‘metaphysical’ or unscientific. - Alastair I. M. Rae
====
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed – so this is a healthy reminder to not fall for overly simplistic explanations often supported by Einstein words: if you can't explain something simply you don't know it well enough. Reality is messy and has granularity that isn't easy to grasp. 
====
Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again. - André Gid
====
"The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein
====
"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving." - Albert Einstein
====
"This is my work. I have to take full responsibility for doing it right as well as doing it wrong. Doing it wrong isn’t bad, but doing it wrong and thinking you’ve done it right is." - Toni Morrison
====
To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion. - Stephen Hawking
====
"If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week." - Charles Darwin
====
Communication is limited by perspective. - Andrei Tarkovsky
====
“Simplicity is the key to brilliance.” - Bruce Lee
====
This capture in a mantra like simplicity what makes human communication so complicated. 
====
The content or message of any particular medium has about as much importance as the stenciling on the casing of an atomic bomb. - Marshall McLuhan
====
The medium is the message. Get off your phone. Everyone has an agenda. Channels are endless. You can't truly control your exposure anymore - at least not without taking drastic measures. Focus defuse the bomb. 
====
The unit of survival is organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself. - Gregory Bateson
====
As the global warming crisis is unfolding, let's keep in mind this fundamental principle. Both side seem to agree on the principle but not on what the environement truly is. 
====
Conversation – whether with other people or with ourselves – remains our only means of making intelectual and moral progress. - Sam Harris
====
The hundreds of hours of conversation with my wife have proven this over and over again. Thought crystalizes during conversation and get beaten down to it essence. As imperfect as human communication is, it remain our best tool to make sense of things. 
====
An imperfect solution that exists outperforms a perfect one that doesn't.
Facebook wasn't the first social network - it was just the one that kept iterating and showing up. The Wright brothers weren't the most educated aviation pioneers, but they were the ones who got a plane off the ground.
What you build matters more than what you could have built.
====
Honesty requires that we each radically reduce our expectations that machines will do our work for us or that therapists can make us learned or healthy. - Ivan Illich
====
“One who looks around him is intelligent; one who looks within him is wise.” - Matshona Dhliwayo
====
I spent my 20s accumulating stuff, habit, money. Entering my 30s I came to realize that a bit of that wisdom that come with aging is about unlearning certain behavior and expectations. The value of putting the work, examining yourselfs becaome more real but also easier to ignore or escape over time. You can't beat entropy, even if technology makes you think you can. 
====
There is no product or service more ecological, sustainable and recyclable as the one we do not use. - Philippe Bihouix
====
In a time where we all seem to struggle to find truly sustainable solutions we tend to forget that not doing, producing, making, buying is the most relevent path. The oxymoronic nature of this is a necessary acknowledgment in a world obsessed about growth. May this be a helpful way to remember that not doing is always the cheapest and often the truly virtuous path. 
====
The main distinction between meditation and our usual hap hazard thinking is coherence; it should be an ascetical exercise of intellectual sobriety.  - Anthony bloom
====
The man is richest whose pleasure are cheapest - Thoreau
====
I found too much peace in letting go of many physical things to not agree with this timeless observation. Whether it's appreciating the taste of an boiled egg, the feeling of a pencil or a nap; there seem to be a relationship between the nature of a pleasure and the it's ability to connect us with a sense of presence on one's life.  
====
Sometimes you don't know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory - Gunnar Freyr
====
Building a relationship with my wife and telling stories of my childhood has crystalized this simple fact of life. As I'm thinking of my own future child, I realize that a lot of his worldview will be through his memories - all of them. 
====
The plural of anecdote is data. - George J. Stigler
====
I've spent a few years obsessing over data. Personal tracking, work metrics, studies... The need to test and prove is real and understandable but generally has too high of a cost for the insight it brings. I should not have needed a wearable to tell me the value of sleep. An honest conversation should have been enough. 
====
Like our stomachs, our minds are hurt more often by overeating than by hunger. - Petrarch
====
We rarely underdo anything as a species. Removing something bad often yield better result that adding two good things. 
====
Most tools are boring, until they’re not, and then they become miraculous. The onus is on the craftsperson to figure out how to escape the boredom. - Craig Mod
====
I design websites. Nothing exciting in itself by now. My only real interest in this craft if to create that little touch that will make an experience standout without overdoing it. Tempering the ego to let work be work is has been hard. A good tool often looks beautifully boring. It's a process, both on the creation and relationship side. 
====
I'm just another fool. All of us live knowing this. Few are able keep this as a mantra. I get caught up too often. 
====
The ones who will be able to afford the autonomous car, are already sitting in the back seat. - Carlos Tavares
====
Sometimes I believe in the power of individuals. Because our actions compound we get to all shape the world right? Nope – Decisions trickle down most of the time. 
====
Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd. - Voltaire
====
When something feels too clear, maybe you're actually don't get it. But if you feel struct by how unsatisfying your understanding feels, you're probably closer. 
====
The learning of many things doesn't teach understanding of anything. - Heraclitus
====
Too many overeducted people have stated the relative futility of their education. An examined life seem the only path to the a form understanding. Note after note. This is the closest we’ll ever get to knowledge and hopefully die in peace. 
====
The defenders of our freedom have failed to take into account our Infinite appetite for distraction. - Aldous Huxley
====
Our current liberal democracies can't keep their integrity because we've all lost most of our attention span, thus most of critical thinking. 
====
Wisdom lies in correctly discerning where we are free to mold reality to our desires and where we must accept the unaltered with tranquility. - Seneca
====
Human have clearly overstepped the boundaries of what stoic would have called reasonalble. Nature is not here to please us and we should not always bend it to our desires. Don't build a house at the feet of volcano. 
====
Democracy has no capability to prevent its development towards totalitarism when resources become scarce. - Lasse Norlund
====
Scarcity is the one thing you can never have enough of. - Marc Randolph
====
The concept of post scarcity annoys me as it feels so detached from reality. There is too many things not working in our current system to be that delusional. We all need food, water and shelter. The condition for widespread access to this is a precarious balance. 
====
Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished. - Lao Tzu
====
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience. - Ralph Waldo Emerson.
====
"An Evil Man will burn his own nation to the ground to rule over the ashes." - Sun Tzu
====
“If you never change your mind, why have one?” - Edward de Bono
====
Gardening taught me something beyond patience. An acknowledgment of the perfection in all things. 
====
There is no gardening without humility. Nature is constantly sending even its oldest scholars to the bottom of the class for some egregious blunder. - Alfred Austin
====
The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just the body, but the soul. - Alfred Austin
====
Remember that children, marriages, and flower gardens reflect the kind of care they get. - H. Jackson Brown, Jr.
====
Gardens are not made by singing "Oh, how beautiful," and sitting in the shade. - Rudyard Kipling
====
Everything that slows us down and forces patience, everything that sets us back into the slow circles of nature, is a help. Gardening is an instrument of grace. - May Sarton
====
The garden suggests there might be a place where we can meet nature halfway. - Michael Pollan
====
I like gardening—it's a place where I find myself when I need to lose myself. - Alice Sebold
====
When the world wearies and society fails to satisfy, there is always the garden. - Minnie Aumonier
====
The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. - Michael Pollan
====
It will never rain roses: When we want to have more roses, we must plant more trees. - George Eliot
====
A weed is but an unloved flower. - Ella Wheeler Wilcox
====
Everything has been said before, but since nobody listens we have to keep going back and beginning all over again. - André Gide
====
I started this collection to solve exaclty this. Everything as been said before, better than I could say it. I tried many time to give my own free thinking some space and envergy but ended up with mediocre notes that can often be summarize in few words - hence this. 
====
I don't like training but I don't like dying either, so I'm going to train. - Beau Miles
====
"Without goals, training has no direction." - Natalie Coughlin
====
Discipline should have a purpose. Training certainly has one. All essentials practices can be and should be considered training. From the obvious physical ones to the more subtles ones, like boredom. 
====
There is meaning and satisfaction in living close to the source of things. - Masanobu Fukuoka
====
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead
====
We are so removed from the orgini of most things that populate our lives. Objects manufactured on the other side of the world, plants cultivated hundreds of miles away. The concept of autonomy start by getting physically closer to things to change our relationship the the processes and resources amking our lives what they are. 
====
We should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. - Hanlon's razor
====
It took me too long time to properly use and understand this popular adage. Often used as a convenient intelectual shortcut to avoid having to really make an effort to thinking critically. 
====
All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone - Blaise Pascal
====
One thought to rule them all. The ability to not think as the ultimate skill for healthy function. 
====
Beware the stories you read or tell; subtly, at night, beneath the waters of consciousness, they are altering your world. - Ben Okri
====
Everything is a constructed story. We're here today thanks to them but also miserable because of them. They should be seen for what they are, devices. 
====
“The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.” - William James
====
The part can never be well unless the whole is well. - Plato
====
It's easy to fall for incremetnal gain but leave the root cause be. The bigness argument always surface. Sometimes allegedly. Often as rejection of the true origin, or worse, intelectual dishonesty. 
====
Rejection isn’t a verdict; it’s data. Use it.
====
He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch. - Jean-Luc Godard
====
Being different is okay. Knowing that difference and not allowing alienation is recommended. 
====
Don't like trucks? Stop buying shit! Problem solved - Bumper sticker on the I5
====
Consumerism is not easy to bear. Its waste is in our face all the time. We tend to grow numb to it. I still can't stand the diffuse sound of the distant freeway in the night. It reminds me too much of my lack of autonomy. 
====
The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. - Ralph Waldo Emerson
====
"Greatness is not measured by what a man or woman accomplishes, but by the opposition he or she has overcome to reach his [or her] goals." - Dorothy Height
====
There isn't much else we should aspire to in life. Do the right thing and derive from our action the feeling of having done our part; or at least, enough. 
====
Their mistakes did more of the teaching than the explicit virtues they were trying to instill in me. - Sharon
====
Learning something sometimes happens in very indirect ways. Observing these ways teaches us as much as the lessons themselves. 
====
As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death - Leonardo da Vinci
====
A good day now brings no anxiety. A bad one brings relief. Sleep is the training. 
====
There is a beauty and clarity that comes from simplicity that we sometimes do not appreciate in our thirst for intricate solutions - Dieter F. Uchtdorf
====
We engineer everything these day. Consider the simple beauty of the ultimate complexity of nature - the simplicity of a drop of water and how everything in this world lives thanks to it. Now explain dams. 
====
If hard work made us rich, donkeys would be draped in gold - Heard Craig say this
====
"When you're good at something, you'll tell everyone. When you're great at something, they'll tell you." - Walter Payton
====
The hustle culture makes it easy to forget that input doesn't match output. The idea of meritocracy is not and will never be. 
====
Conquer without struggle and you will succeed without glory - Corneille
====
Alternatively, there doesn't seem to be that many meaningful successes without struggle of some sort. 
====
Find a thing, get good at it, get paid for it - and only then, focus on your passion - Robbie
====
Passion and career are two different things. I was raised told that I should do whatever I feel passionate about so the time passes faster. Being good enough at something is a mean, not an end. Seing how everyone is confused by their relationship to work is strong confirmation of this statement. 
====
For me, letting go actually translated into getting control - The law of the universe at play. - Thomas
====
I always seem to get the opposite of what I want or expect. So much that I now use the law of the universe to intuit the opposite of my intuition and deal with its potential. 
====
Oh dear, I really ought to do something. But I'm already in my pyjamas. - My roommate in the Tenderloin
====
Energy is limited. So is our time, attention, and capacity to care. Our sanity sometimes relies on resource allocation or the awareness of the impossibility of it. 
====
It’s when you look for meaning that you get confused. - C. Bukowski
====
Perhaps I'm doing something wrong here... 
====
Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know - Pema Chödrön
====
I know that something will later make sense on an emotional level. It usually is a subconscious process that crystalizes in a ah-ah moment during a conversation. 
====
Design should be like vanilla ice cream: simple and sweet, plain without being austere. - Franc Chimero
====
The minimalist trends almost always fade away. Nothing stays simple if worked long enough. 
====
You can’t make someone act right but you can make him wish he did - A lady that lives on a boat docked in Sausalito
====
Living life according to your value is the most effective way to change others around you. Lead by example rather than fall into rethoric. 
====
If you can't tell if this is terrible or great. That’s probably a sign you shouldn’t do it. - Repeated by Romain
====
Not doing is very often the best thing to actually do.  
====
True Elegance is knowing what to say and when to say it - Heard in a Nob Hill restaurant
====
I blab. It will be a lifelong journey to balance being a good listener and finding the words. Oh, and patience. 
====
If traveling was free, you'd never see me again - Anthony, Startup employee
====
I heard too many people say that they wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they got rich or the chance to retire early. Beyond traveling, I would certainly not have this issue. I'm interested in too many things to not know what to do beyond capital producing work. 
====
I do it for the memories. - Sasha in SoMa
====
The why of certain action should be considered beyond rational and pragmatic thought. 
====
The more you know, the less you need - A design book I flipped through
====
Strange words to retain from a book. The inverse relationship between knowldge and consumption is hard visceraly accept. 
====
I learn everyday to allow the space between where I want to be and where I am to inspire me and not terrify me. - Ichika while visiting SF MoMa
====
People say oddly inspiring things while looking at art. 
====
It's okay to love something a little too much, as long as it's real to you - Jeffrey Ismael
====
Reminded me of Bukowski without the usual booze or self destruction reference. Also we don't all share the same definition of reality. Even within ourselves, the two emispheres of our brains index things differently. Both are okay, they just need to be corretly labelled. 
====
It's nice to know that everyone else is a mess as well - A guy a met in Party in Nob Hill
====
Random encounters are important to create impressions that will last forever in your mind. That's the only thing he said to me. This guy seemed totally normal. 
====
Sometimes you are so far behind, you'd think you are first - Mimosa dean
====
I'm not interested in things that everyone seeks. It sometimes gives me a feeling of superiority but it's moslty alienating. When people talk about things as a race, it's often not a good sign. The good is an infinite game. Then you die. 
====
Be nice.<br>Be useful.<br>Bring wine. - My chinese roommate
====
I don't drink. I'm particularly nice. But I like to be useful. Social constructs are deeply anchored and there is little to be gained by trying to break them publicaly. Going with the flow sometimes make sense. 
====
The next big thing will be a lot of small things. - A wall in Mission District
====
Decentralization has been and will be a big topic, forever. The appeal of centralization makes to much sense in a capitalist world. Yet we all know that ethics is local. 
====
You don’t get to decide the truth. Life is b —much bigger than just yours. - Franck Chimero
====
There is very few truths. Even fewer that I truly know or understand. Being at peace with our lack of understanding of ourselves is crucial. 
====
“It isn’t what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.” - Dale Carnegie
====
People have a funny way of looking at the world in the way they cut the data. They're not honest with themselves ... they are not looking at the way the world really is as opposed to the way that they want the world to be.
This is the internal war that people have to fight to get to what the truth is and ultimately what success looks like, and how you get closer to success. - Steve Cohen
====
“We often fixate on the visible and exciting, overlooking that most success comes from consistently doing the mundane, unglamorous work that few notice. The 98/2 Rule: people spend 98% of their time talking about flashy things that contribute only 2% to the results, while overlooking the fact that 98% of the results come from consistently doing the boring basics that few notice.
Ask yourself: Does the attention you give to something truly reflect its true importance?”
====
“If you can't be a fan, don't be a critic.”
====
“The difference between average results and exceptional if often found in what you don't do. Everyone can say yes to great opportunities but only a focused person will say no to average ones. You can do anything, but you can’t do everything.”
====
There is no such thing as a quantum leap. There is only dogged persistence – and in the end, you make it look like a quantum leap. - James Dyson
====
Keep the goal. Change your mind about how to reach it.

"There was one of two things I had a right to, liberty, or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other." - Harriet Tubman
====
"A constitution, as important as it is, will mean nothing unless the people are yearning for liberty and freedom." - Ruth Bader Ginsburg
====
The more you create, the more powerful you become. The more you consume the more powerful others become - James Clear
====
"It is foolish to think that you have to read all the books you buy, as it is foolish to criticize those who buy more books than they will ever be able to read. It would be like saying that you should use all the cutlery or glasses or screwdrivers or drill bits you bought before buying new ones.
"There are things in life that we need to always have plenty of supplies, even if we will only use a small portion.
"If, for example, we consider books as medicine, we understand that it is good to have many at home rather than a few: when you want to feel better, then you go to the 'medicine closet' and choose a book. Not a random one, but the right book for that moment. That's why you should always have a nutrition choice!
"Those who buy only one book, read only that one and then get rid of it. They simply apply the consumer mentality to books, that is, they consider them a consumer product, a good. Those who love books know that a book is anything but a commodity." - Umberto Eco

“There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your own way.” - Christopher Morley
====
“Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.” - Howard Aiken
====
“One of the hardest things for a beginner to do is merely to get started on his first set of comic strips. It is strange that most people who have ambitions in the cartoon field are not willing to put in the great amount of work that many other people do in comparable fields. Most people who have comic-strip ambition wish to be able to draw only two or three weeks' material and then have it marketed. They are not willing to go through many years of apprenticeship.” - Charles Schulz
====
A cartoonist is someone who has to draw the same thing day after day without repeating himself. - Charles M. Schulz
====
“A risk with watching your competition too closely is that you get drawn into playing their game and lose focus on your own.”
====
“It's not enough to simply apply effort; you must work on the right thing.
One hour solving the right problem beats ten hours on the wrong one.
Spend time thinking about what to focus on.”

“The happiest people want the lowest profile.”
====
“The cold water doesn't get warmer if you jump late.” - Unknown
====
“There is no safe investment. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.” - C. S. Lewis
====
“We’re less committed to choices we think we can reverse, and commitment is crucial for happiness.” - Logan Ury
====
“Courage is knowing it might hurt, and doing it anyway. Stupidity is the same. And that's why life is hard.” - Jeremy Goldberg
====
“Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson
====
“The price of success is paid in private. Visible triumphs are built on invisible work.”
====
“Most people are interested. Few are truly committed. Interested people act when it's convenient; committed people act no matter what. Interested people do the minimum; committed people push beyond limits. Interested people wait to be told; committed people take the initiative. Fully committing is the key to accomplishment.”

 When I walked into the kitchen again, I was hopping mad. I slammed the plastic bottle on the counter. “I’ve just become president of PepsiCo, and you couldn’t just stop and listen to my news,” I said, loudly. “You just wanted me to go get the milk!” “Listen to me,” my mother replied. “You may be the president or whatever of PepsiCo, but when you come home, you are a wife and a mother and a daughter. Nobody can take your place. “So you leave that crown in the garage.” - Indra Nooyi
====
stealing like an artist: “Just looking at something and going, I like that, and then trying to break down, why do I like that? What is it about that… that I like? What do I steal? What can I repurpose or tweak to make it fit what we’re trying to do? It’s just homework, and the best part of this job is that your homework is watching great movies.” - Steven Soderbergh
====
“There is a phrase, variations of which many of the subjects of this book ended up uttering at some point. As they were describing why they did this or that, they would say they ’listened’ to the work, or the work would ‘tell’ them what to do; the work would ’speak’ to them, as if a character in a book or a color on a canvas could issue orders…. For a long while, I dismissed this phrasing as cliché - more of the empty language people often employ to describe how they work because creation is so hard to describe. Eventually, however, I began to think that no, maybe listening was the whole deal.” - Adam Moss, "The Work of Art"
====
“Let’s keep in mind that there is not one of us whose reputation would not be grievously dimmed by a thorough cataloguing of our faults and errors.” - Carl Braun
====
"One thing seems more and more evident to me now — people’s basic character does not change over the years … Far from improving them, success usually accentuates their faults or short-comings. The brilliant guys at school often turn out to be not so brilliant once they are out in the world. If you disliked or despised certain lads in your class you will dislike them even more when they become financiers, statesmen or five star generals. Life forces us to learn a few lessons, but not necessarily to grow." - Henry Miller

“The question is not whether we will die, but how we will live.” - Dr. Joan Borysenko

“Vision without action is merely a dream. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world.” - Joel Arthur Barker Ratcliffe

“Two real friends that love you are better than a hundred people that kinda like you.”

“Commitment starts when motivation stops.”
====
“It is so much more fun to be a little richer than you were yesterday, than merely to be rich.” - Alice Wellington Rollins
====
“I’m very pleased to think that there are people with whom I agree on some issues and not others. I don’t want a world in which we all agree. I want a world in which people feel that they have the standing and confidence to feel that they can disagree. I’m interested in why people think as they do.” - Mary Beard
====
“Good and evil both increase at compound interest. That is why the little decisions you and I make every day are of such infinite importance. The smallest good act today is the capture of a strategic point from which, a few months later, you may be able to go on to victories you never dreamed of. An apparently trivial indulgence in lust or anger today is the loss of a ridge or railway line or bridgehead from which the enemy may launch an attack otherwise impossible.” - C.S. Lewis
====
“The right time was yesterday. The best time is now.”
====
“Too many people want to be something to everyone and end up being nothing to anyone. Universal appeal means universal indifference.”
====
“School tests weaknesses. Life rewards strengths.
====
Spending more time on our weakest areas is tempting, but life mostly rewards us for investing in our strengths. Imagine a student who struggles with math but excels at writing. In school, they might spend hours raising their math grades from a C to a B. However, spending the same time on writing might move them from an A to an A+. Focusing on math makes sense when you're taught to think in grades. It doesn't make sense if you think about life. The difference between an A and an A+ in writing ability might mean the difference between a New York Times bestseller read by millions and a book that only 100 people read.” Address weaknesses only to the point where they stop holding you back. Then concentrate effort on your strengths.

Mental Models
The Map Is Not the Territory
"The map is not the territory is a reminder that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It’s a caution against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-shifting reality they aim to describe.
Mistaking the maps for the territory is dangerous. Consider the person who has a great résumé and checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the actual job. Updating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.
In many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely, to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.
Ultimately, the map/territory distinction is an invitation to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it to be. And remember, when you don’t make the map yourself, choose your cartographer wisely."

V1 | General Thinking Tools | Probabilistic Thinking
Probabilistic thinking is the art of navigating uncertainty. Success- fully thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, coming up with a sense of the odds, checking our assumptions, and then deciding.
The challenge of probabilistic thinking is that it requires constant updating. As new information emerges, the probabilities change. What seemed likely yesterday may seem unlikely today. This explains why probabilistic thinkers always revise their beliefs with new data and why it’s uncomfortable for many people.
It’s much easier to believe something false is true than to deal with the fact that it might not be true. Being a probabilistic thinker means being willing to say, “I don’t know for sure, but based on the evidence, I think there’s a 63 percent chance of X.”
The rewards of probabilistic thinking are immense. By embracing uncertainty, we can make better decisions, avoid the pitfalls of overconfidence, and navigate complex situations with greater skill and flexibility. We can be more open- minded, more receptive to new ideas, and more resilient in the face of change.

V1 | General Thinking Tools | Inversion
A lot of advantages can be gained simply by avoiding the standard paths to failure.
Inversion is not the way we are taught to think. We are taught to identify what we want and explore things that will move us closer to our objective. However, by identifying and avoiding things that will ensure we don’t get what we want, we dramatically increase our odds of success.
Often, we get so fixated on solving a problem in a particular way that we miss simpler, more elegant solutions. Inversion forces us to consider the opposite side of the equation. Instead of asking, “How do I solve this problem?” inversion asks, “What would guarantee failure?”
Instead of asking, “How can I achieve this goal?” it asks, “What is preventing me from achieving it?” By inverting the question, we can gain insights that our normal thought patterns might miss.
The next time you find yourself struggling, try inverting your thinking. Ask yourself how you could guarantee failure. The answers may surprise you and open up new avenues for possible solutions.

V1 | General Thinking Concepts | First Principles
"First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective.
Thinking in terms of first principles allows us to identify the root causes and strip away the layers of complexity and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible.
First principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those who are willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.
In a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.”

V1 | General Thinking Tools | Second-Order Thinking
Second-order thinking is a method of thinking that goes beyond the surface level, beyond the knee-jerk reactions and short-term gains. It asks us to play the long game, to anticipate the ripple effects of our actions, and to make choices that will benefit us not just today but in the months and years to come.
Second-order thinking demands we ask: And then what?
Think of a chess master contemplating her next move. She doesn’t just consider how the move will affect the next turn but how it will shape the entire game. She’s thinking many steps ahead. She’s considering her own strategy and her opponent’s likely response.
In our daily lives, we’re often driven by first-order thinking. We make decisions based on what makes us happy now, what eases our current discomfort, or satisfies our immediate desires.

V1 | General Thinking Tools | Thought Experiment
Thought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, a place where we can play with ideas without constraints. They’re a way of exploring the implications of our theories, of testing the boundaries of our understanding. They offer a powerful tool for clarifying our thinking, revealing hidden assumptions, and showing us unintended consequences.
The power of thought experiments lies in their ability to create a simplified model of reality where we can test our ideas. In the real world, there are always confounding factors, messy details that obscure the core principles at work. However, in a thought experiment, we can strip away the noise and focus on the essence of the problem.
Thought experiments remind us that some of the most profound insights and innovations start with a simple question: What if?

V1 | General Thinking Tools | Occam's Razor
Occam’s razor is the intellectual equivalent of “keep it simple.”
When faced with competing explanations or solutions, Occam’s razor suggests that the correct explanation is most likely the simplest one, making the fewest assumptions.
This doesn’t mean the simplest theory is always true, only that it should be preferred until proven otherwise. Sometimes, the truth is complex, and the simplest explanation doesn’t account for all the facts.
The key to Occam's Razor is understanding when it works for you and against you. A theory that is too simple will fail to capture reality, and one that is too complex will collapse under its own weight.

V2 | Chemistry | Alloying
Alloying is the art of mixing elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. While our intuition tells us that pure substances are best, alloying shows this is not always true. One plus one can equal ten. By blending ingredients in precise proportions, metallurgists can create materials with bespoke properties—the lightness of aluminum with the strength of steel, the corrosion resistance of chromium with the affordability of iron.
But alloying isn’t just about physical properties. It’s a metaphor for the power of diversity and combination in all walks of life. In teams, alloying is the mixing of different skills, perspectives, and personalities to create a more creative, adaptable, and resilient group than any individual could be alone. In ideas, it’s the blending of concepts from different fields to spark innovation and insight.
In people, alloying is the combination of skills that makes them unstoppable. Consider a person possessing deep engineering skills who can clearly explain ideas. They are more valuable than someone with just the engineering skills. Now add empathy, humility, resilience, and drive. This person becomes incredibly rare.
The key to successful alloying is knowing which elements to combine and in what proportions. Too little of one ingredient and you don’t get the desired effect; too much and you might end up with something brittle or unstable. The art lies in finding the sweet spot, the golden ratio where the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.

V2 | Physics | Leverage
Leverage is the force multiplier of the world, the principle that allows the small to move the large and the few to influence the many. It’s the idea that a little force, strategically applied, can yield outsize outputs.
At its core, leverage is amplification. Think of a crowbar prying two boards apart or a pulley system hoisting a heavy load. In each case, the applied force is multiplied. But leverage isn’t just useful in physics. Rather, it’s a principle that applies across our lives.
Leverage is often lurking in the background of nonlinear outcomes. Consider the author who took the ideas in their head, put them in a book, and sold millions of copies, or the Wall Street investor who made a single decision that resulted in billions. Or even the CEO who directs the people working for them. All of these examples are leverage in action.
In personal development, leverage is about identifying the key habits, skills, and relationships that will impact your life and work most. It’s about focusing your energy on the critical few rather than the trivial many, about finding the points of maximum leverage where small changes can cascade into massive results.
An example of personal leverage is an employee who learns to use AI to amplify their impact on the organization far beyond their experience or effort. While labor is still a form of leverage, it can often be done with silicon chips. In this sense, the person who can leverage technology can compete in a way never imaginable.
However, leverage is not without its risks and responsibilities. Just as a small action can have an outsized positive impact, so can it have negative consequences. If you borrow too much money against your house and it turns out to be less valuable than assumed or interest rates change, the downside of leverage can quickly wipe you out.
Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one’s ability to be truly effective. No one wants to feel exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work.
The key is to use leverage wisely and judiciously by understanding the systems you want to influence and considering the second- and third- order effects of your actions.
Leverage is a tool, not a toy, and like any tool, it requires skill, judgment, and respect.

V2 | Physics | Reciprocity
"Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex trade systems. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get. From this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives.

V2 | Chemistry | Activation Energy
Activation energy is the spark that ignites the fire of change, the initial burst of effort required to kick-start a reaction or transformation. It’s the metaphorical push that gets the boulder rolling down the hill, the investment of energy needed to overcome inertia and set a process in motion.
In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy that must be input for a reaction. It’s the hurdle molecules must overcome to break their bonds and form new ones, the energetic barrier separating the reactants from the products.
But activation energy isn’t just a chemical concept. It’s a principle that applies to any system where change is possible but not automatic. In personal growth, activation energy is the effort required to break old habits and form new ones. In innovation, it’s the investment needed to turn an idea into reality.
The key is recognizing activation energy for what it is: a necessary upfront cost, not a permanent obstacle. Once things are moving, momentum takes over. Once the reaction starts, it becomes self-sustaining.

Mental Model
V2 | Physics | Inertia
"Inertia is the stubborn resistance of the universe to change. It’s the reason why objects at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. You can think of inertia as the guardian of the status quo.
At its core, inertia is a property of mass. The more massive an object is, the more it resists changes to its state of motion. A feather, with its tiny mass, is easily blown about by the slightest breeze. A boulder, on the other hand, requires a powerful force to get it moving. This is why it takes more effort to push a heavy cart than a light one, more energy to launch a rocket than to toss a ball.
But inertia isn’t just a physical phenomenon. It’s an illuminating lens to see habits, beliefs, and our resistance to change. The longer we’ve held them, the larger the mass and the more force required to change them. The path of least resistance is always the status quo.
Getting started is the hardest part. Once something is moving in a direction, it’s much easier to keep it in motion. But once something is in motion, it’s hard to stop. This is why most self-help books about positive habits break things down into very small steps—to reduce the force required to overcome the status quo. For example, if you want to get in the habit of doing push-ups daily, start with one rather than with fifty. If you want to start a flossing habit, start with one tooth. After all, the bigger the mass—in this case the gap between where you are and where you want to be—the more effort required.
Inertia is both a challenge and an opportunity. Successful companies struggle with the inertia of their own success and the resistance to change that comes with size, complexity, and entrenched interests. Startups, on the other hand, can leverage their lack of inertia—their agility, their willingness to pivot and adapt—as a competitive advantage.
Momentum and inertia are closely related. While inertia is the tendency to resist change, momentum is the oomph an object has when it’s moving. The more momentum something has, the harder it is to stop or redirect. The key is to pick the right direction and build momentum so inertia works to your advantage and carries you forward. This is the essence of the “flywheel” concept in business—the idea that success breeds success, that small wins can compound into big gains over time.
When you’re fighting the status quo, remember the physics at play. Resistance is natural. Understand that it takes a sustained force in the right direction to build momentum in a new direction.
While the universe resists change, it always rewards those who dare to overcome that resistance.”

Mental Model
V2 | Physics | Relativity
Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute, but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective.
We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, what we value and dismiss.
Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference. Consider two people standing in the same room: They experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same.
However, relativity is not the same as relativism— the idea that all perspectives are equally valid. Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Rather, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference.
We all have blind spots— things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly.

V2 | Physics | Velocity
Velocity is the great differentiator, distinguishing the stagnant from the swift.
In physics, velocity is a fundamental quantity, a key variable in the equations that describe the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. It’s the v in the formulas of motion, the arrow that points the way from here to there.
Velocity is also a metaphor for life. Consider it the rate at which we learn and grow, the speed at which we innovate and create, and the focus with which we pursue our goals.
Velocity challenges us to think about what we can do to put ourselves on the right trajectory, to find a balance between mass and speed to move toward our goals. The ability to set a direction, improve your tactics, and adjust to new information becomes paramount.
Velocity isn’t just about raw speed. Direction matters as much. A car moving at high speed in circles goes nowhere, while a slow, steady walk in a straight line can cross continents.
Velocity is progress. Sometimes progress comes from adding more force, and sometimes, progress comes from removing friction. Once you have a destination, you can improve your velocity by working harder and eliminating things that aren’t contributing toward reaching that goal.

V3 | Systems | Feedback Loops
Feedback loops are the engines of growth and change. They’re the mechanisms by which the output of a system influences its input.
Complex systems often have many feedback loops, and it can be hard to appreciate how adjusting to feedback in one part of the system will affect the rest.
Using feedback loops as a mental model begins with noticing the feedback you give and respond to daily. The model also provides insight into the value of iterations in adjusting based on the feedback you receive. With this lens, you gain insight into where to direct system changes based on feedback and the pace you need to go to monitor the impacts.
Feedback loops are what make systems dynamic. Without feedback, a system does the same thing over and over. Understand them, respect them, and use them wisely.

V3 | Systems | Churn
Churn is the silent killer of businesses. It’s the slow leak, the constant drip of customers slipping away, of users drifting off to find something new. The attrition eats away at your growth, forcing you to keep running to stay in place.
The thing about churn is that it’s often hidden. It’s not like a crisis that grabs your attention. It’s a slow, quiet process that happens in the background. Churn can present opportunity. Like a snake shedding its skin, replacing components of a system is a natural part to keeping it healthy. New parts can improve functionality.
But here's what's counterintuitive: some churn is healthy. New employees bring new ideas; new customers bring new opportunities. Replacing what is worn out creates new opportunities. Some churn is inevitable. Too much can kill you.

V3 | Systems | Margin of Safety
Margin of safety is a secret weapon. It’s the buffer, the extra capacity, the redundancy that you build into a system to handle unexpected stress. It’s the difference between a bridge that can barely handle the expected load, and one that can hold ten times that load without breaking a sweat.
You can apply a margin of safety to any area of life with risk. The key is always asking yourself: What if I’m wrong? What if things don’t go as planned?
But here's the rub: margin of safety isn't free. It means spending more upfront. In the short term, you'll look overly cautious and leave immediate profits on the table. But in the long run, this apparent overcaution lets you survive when others break - and thrive when others merely survive.
Margin of safety is the unsung hero of long-term success. It’s not flashy. It’s not exciting, but it’s the foundation on which everything else is built. Master it, and you’ll be well on your way to navigating the uncertainties of life with confidence and stability.

"Algorithms are recipes. A list of crisp, unambiguous steps that tell you how to get from point A to point B. But they’re more than just instructions. Algorithms are if‑then machines for tuning out the noise and zeroing in on the signal. Have the specs been met? Follow the algorithm and find out.
Thinking algorithmically means searching for processes that reliably spit out the desired results, like a vending machine dispensing the same candy bar every time someone punches in E4.”

V3 | Systems | Equilibrium
Equilibrium is the state of balance, where opposing forces cancel each other out. It’s the calm in the center of the storm, the stable point around which the chaos swirls. In a system at equilibrium, there’s no net change. Everything is in a steady state, humming along at a constant pace.
However, systems are rarely static. They continuously adjust toward equilibrium but rarely stay in balance for long. Equilibrium is a  double-edged sword, both stability and stagnation. In our lives, we often act like we can reach an equilibrium: once we get into a relationship, we’ll be happy; once we move, we’ll be productive; once X thing happens, we’ll be in Y state. But things are always in flux. We don’t reach a certain steady state and then stay there forever. The endless adjustments are our lives. The trick is to find the right balance, to strive for equilibrium where it’s needed, but to also know when to break free, to embrace the dis-equilibrium that drives progress.

V3 | Systems | Bottlenecks
Bottlenecks are the choke points, the narrow parts of the hourglass where everything slows down. They’re the constraints that limit the flow, the weakest links in the chain that determine the strength of the whole. In any system, the bottleneck is the part holding everything else back.
The tricky thing about bottlenecks is that they’re not always obvious. It’s easy to focus on the parts of the system that are moving quickly and assume everything is fine. But the real leverage is in finding and fixing the bottlenecks. Speed up the slowest part, and you speed up the whole system. This is the theory of constraints in a nutshell. Figure out your bottleneck and focus all your efforts on alleviating it. Don’t waste time optimizing the parts that are already fast. They’re not the limiting factor. However, bottlenecks aren’t always the villains we make them out to be. Sometimes, they’re a necessary part of the system. Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. It slows everything down, but it’s there for a reason. Remove it, and you might speed things up, but at the cost of safety.
The key is to be intentional about your bottlenecks. Choose them wisely and make sure they serve a purpose. A deliberate bottleneck can be a powerful tool for focusing effort and maintaining quality, while an accidental bottleneck is just a drag on the system. Bottlenecks are the leverage points where a little effort can go a long way.

V4 | Economics | Interdependence

Interdependence is the web that ties us all together. It’s the recognition that no person, no company, no country is an island. We’re all connected, all reliant on one another in countless ways, big and small. Interdependence is the reality that underlies the illusion of self-sufficiency. No one is entirely self-made.

Interdependence can be both a vulnerability and a strength. When we recognize our interdependencies, we can leverage them for mutual benefit. We can form alliances, partnerships, and ecosystems. We can create value that no single entity could create alone.

Interdependence is the foundation of synergy, the alchemy of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, if we depend on others for something critical, it can expose us if they fail to deliver or change their minds. It’s easy to be a good partner when things are going well. But you want to be careful with whom you depend in a crisis.

Interdependence isn’t just a macro concept. It’s deeply personal. We’re all interdependent with our families, our friends, our communities. We rely on one another for support, for love, for meaning. Interdependence is the fabric of our social lives.

V4 | Art | Audience

The audience is the invisible participant in every work of art. They are the eyes that see, the ears that hear, the minds that interpret. Without an audience, art is like a tree falling in an empty  forest— it may make a sound, but does it matter? The audience is what gives art its meaning, its purpose, and its very existence.
Every observer infuses art with personal significance, transforming it into a co-creation. A painting of a sunset may evoke feelings of peace and beauty for one person and feelings of melancholy and loss for another. The artwork is the same, but the audience is different, so the meaning is different. In this sense, the audience is a cocreator of the art.
Great artists design their work for these silent judges, balancing authenticity with expectation without succumbing to pandering. The audience is their silent collaborator and their ultimate judge.
The audience is something real in a world where so much can be faked. You can fake likes, followers, and reviews, but you can’t fake the genuine human experience of engaging with art. The spontaneous laughter, unexpected tears, and long, thoughtful silence are the honest reactions that both the audience and the artist lives for.
Never forget your audience, but never let them dictate your creation.

In a world of infinite knowledge and finite time, specialization is the key to unlocking mastery. It’s about going deep, not wide.
Specialization has risks. If the world changes, what was once a valuable specialty can become obsolete. And yet, we need specialists. You wouldn’t want a generalist doing your brain surgery or a root canal.
Ultimately, specialization is about where you spend your time and effort. It’s how you stand out. It’s choosing to be great at one thing instead of okay at many.

Optimization is about making the most of what you have. It’s like cleverly solving a puzzle, finding a trick to skip steps and get to the answer faster.
In a world of scarcity, optimization is powerful. It allows us to make the most of our limited resources, whether that’s time, money, or energy. But like any tool, it’s only as good as the hand that wields it. Used wisely, optimization unlocks hidden potential and drives extraordinary results. Used poorly, it leads to wasted effort and missed opportunities.
Optimization often works for you until it doesn’t. It’s like the student who writes the answer but doesn’t show their work. Knowing when to use it, when to let it go, and when to avoid it, gives you a key advantage.

V4 | Economics and Art | Scarcity
The rarest thing you possess is your own potential.
"Scarcity shapes our choices and drives our actions. When something is scarce, it suddenly becomes valuable. We want it more because there is less. This principle underlies everything from the price of gold to the thrill of the hunt.
Scarcity isn’t just about material things. It applies to time, opportunities, and ideas. It’s why we’re drawn to the exclusive, the  limited-edition, the one-of-a-kind.
In economics, scarcity is a foundational principle. There are infinite wants and desires but limited resources. We can’t have everything, so we must choose. Scarcity guides those choices.
Some businesses operate with a scarcity mentality, removing shock absorbers and operating lean, with just enough resources to produce the day’s goods. This model is prone to disruption with the slightest hiccup and signals to employees that they’re in a culture of scarcity, triggering our biological instinct toward self-preservation. We subconsciously hoard things of value to gain an individual advantage.
Scarcity can work to your advantage. Imagine you’ve got a rare combination of qualities: honest, hardworking, and smart. People like that are scarce, and the world tends to reward them disproportionately. It’s not just about being good at one thing; it’s about having a mix of traits.
The key to navigating scarcity is understanding its power, recognizing when it’s driving our choices, and asking if those choices align with our true values and goals. Sometimes, scarcity creates real value. But sometimes, it’s just a mirage, a trick of the mind.”

V4 | Economics | Supply and Demand

"Supply and demand are the push and pull determining availability and price. Their dance is never-ending. A sudden shortage can send prices soaring; a discovery can send them crashing.

But supply and demand aren’t just about price; they’re also about allocation. They determine who gets what and how much of it.

Markets react to supply and demand. When supply is low and demand is high, resources flow to those willing and able to pay the most. When demand exceeds supply, companies are encouraged to invest to create substitutes or more supply. On the other hand, when supply exceeds demand, investment is discouraged until a profitable balance is restored.

Economic cycles are driven as much by human nature as by resources. When profits are flowing, it encourages overconfidence, greed, and complacency. When profits are nowhere to be found, it encourages fear, savings, and ruthless efficiency.

As individuals, we’re all part of this dance. Every choice we make as consumers and every decision we make as producers shapes the contours of supply and demand. We are the market, collectively determining what has value and what doesn’t.

Remember the forces at play the next time you’re at the store, negotiating a salary, or launching a product. You’re not just a passive participant but an active agent in supply and demand. Your choices matter. Make them wisely.”

V4 | Economics | Monopoly and Competition

"Monopoly and competition are the yin and yang of the business world. They’re the opposing forces that shape the landscape of every market, the tides that lift and sink the fortunes of every firm. To understand business, you must understand the dance between these poles.

Competition is the default state of the market. It’s the Darwinian struggle where many firms vie for the same customers and resources. In a competitive market, no one firm has the power to set prices or dictate terms. They’re price takers, not price makers. They survive by being efficient, delivering value, and innovating.

If competition is the natural state, monopoly is the entrepreneur’s dream. A monopoly dominates a market so completely that it becomes the market. Think of the only bridge that crosses a river. But monopolies inevitably sow the seeds of their own destruction. The question is how long they will last.

We need both monopoly and competition. Competition keeps firms honest and drives innovation. But we also need monopolies’ deep pockets to fund big visions and moon shots. The ideal is a balance: enough competition to check monopolies, but enough monopoly to reward innovation.”

V4 | Economics | Trade-offs

Life is full of trade-offs. Every choice has a cost. When you say yes to one thing, you say no to others. This is how the world works. It’s like gravity. You can’t escape it.
Opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice. It’s the thing you can’t have because you picked something else. Say you have a free evening. You can work on your startup or go to a movie. If you work, you miss the fun. If you go to the movie, you miss the chance to make progress. Every choice has an opportunity cost because you implicitly say no to many other things every time you say yes to something. You need to know your opportunity costs. This helps you make good trade-offs.
A trade-off is giving up one thing to get something else. It’s choosing between options. Each has good and bad points. Trade-offs are about priorities. When you make something, you face trade-offs. If you want it fast, you might lose some features. If you want it cheap, you might use lower-quality materials.
In life, we face  trade-offs all the time. Do you take the high-paying job with long hours? Or the low-paying one with more free time? Do you spend money now or save for later? Making good trade-offs is about weighing the opportunity costs and benefits of each option and choosing the one that aligns best with your goals and values. It’s not always easy, but being conscious of the  trade-offs you’re making can help you make better decisions.
Wisdom is anticipating the consequences of your choices. In life and business, success is about making good trade-offs. It’s not about having it all. It’s about having what matters most. We all value different things. That’s what makes life rich. Opportunity cost is what you give up when choosing; trade-offs are the balancing acts you perform when deciding between competing options. They’re two sides of the same  coin—whenever you make a trade-off, you incur an opportunity cost for the options you didn’t choose. The key in both cases is to be thoughtful and intentional about your choices.

Those most susceptible to joining mass movements are often dissatisfied with themselves
"The fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure. He cannot generate self-assurance out of his individual resources - out of his rejected self - but finds it only by clinging passionately to whatever support he happens to embrace. This passionate attachment is the essence of his blind devotion and religiosity, and he sees in it the source of all virtue and strength. Though his single-minded dedication is a holding on for dear life, he easily sees himself as the supporter and defender of the holy cause to which he clings. And he is ready to sacrifice his life to demonstrate to himself and others that such indeed is his role. He sacrifices his life to prove his worth."
The movement provides them with a sense of identity and purpose they lack as individuals.

And combining all of those skills together, the art and the science, the thinking and the doing, was what resulted in the exceptional result. And there is no difference in our industry. The people that have really made the contributions have been the thinkers and the doers.” - Steve Jobs

“The short-term crowd is always too distracted to notice the long-term crowd slowly compounding.
An investor obsessing over daily economic data misses the big picture. A teenager chasing fleeting popularity neglects to develop genuine interests and skills. A co-worker stops paying attention to the details to chase attention. All chase false stimuli at the cost of lasting value.
Never try to win the moment at the expense of the decade.”

“Solitude is a condition of peace that stands in direct opposition to loneliness. Loneliness is like sitting in an empty room and being aware of the space around you. It is a condition of separateness. Solitude is becoming one with the space around you. It is a condition of union.” - Kent Nerburn

“When people worry about your mental diet, they tend to fret about the junk you’re pouring into your brain—the trashy videos, the cheap horror movies, the degrading reality TV, and ... I’m not so worried about the dangers of mental junk food. That’s because I’ve found that many of the true intellectuals I’ve met take pleasure in mental junk food too. Having a taste for trashy rom-coms hasn’t rotted their brain or made them incapable of writing great history or doing deep physics. No, my worry is that, you won’t put enough really excellent stuff into your brain. I’m talking about what you might call the “theory of maximum taste.” This theory is based on the idea that exposure to genius has the power to expand your consciousness. If you spend a lot of time with genius, your mind will end up bigger and broader than if you spend your time only with run-of-the-mill stuff. The theory of maximum taste says that each person’s mind is defined by its upper limit—the best that it habitually consumes and is capable of consuming.” - David Brooks (lightly edited for clarity)

Action creates inspiration.
====
“The advice I like to give anybody who’ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work.
All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you’re sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that’s almost never the case.”
— Chuck Close
====
The hard part isn't knowing what to do; it's doing it daily, whether you feel like it or not.
The challenge isn't knowing you should work out; it's putting on your shoes and running in the cold when you'd rather sit at home under a warm blanket. The challenge isn't determining the most important project; it's sitting down and doing it when you'd rather browse social media.
If you're waiting for inspiration, you've already lost.

The most practical skill you can learn is working smarter. But here's what nobody tells you about working smarter: it often looks like you're working slower. A programmer might spend 20 hours wrestling with a difficult algorithm, then have an insight in the shower that solves it in 10 lines of code. Those 20 hours weren't wasted—they were necessary for the insight.
Your first thought is what everyone else thinks. Your best thought comes after you've thought long enough to forget what everyone thinks. The difference between good and exceptional isn't hours worked – it's the depth of thought applied to the right problems.

Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary. - Umberto Eco

Opposable thumbs let us hang on, story told us what to hang on to. Story is what allowed us to envision the future and so prepare for the unexpected. In the same way that food tastes good so we'll eat it, stories are entertaining so we'll pay attention to them. - Lisa Cron

Your body reflects what you eat. Your mind reflects what you consume.
For a healthy body, choose whole foods. For a sharp mind, choose lasting knowledge. What’s lasting knowledge?
It’s wisdom that endures: Timeless principles, foundational ideas, and insights that remain relevant for years, not hours. Before diving into the news or scrolling through feeds, ask: “Will this still matter next year?” If not, it’s probably mental junk food. The sugar high will leave you craving even more. Avoid mental junk food. Feed your mind substance. Your future self will thank you.

“Behavior has replaced action as the foremost mode of human relationship.” - Hannah Arendt, "The Human Condition“

“The mass phenomenon of loneliness…has achieved its most extreme and antihuman form. The reason for this extremity is that mass society not only destroys the public realm but the private as well, deprives men not only of their place in the world but of their private home, where they once felt sheltered against the world.” - Hannah Arendt, "The Human Condition“
====
“The loss of human experience in this development is extraordinarily striking. It is not only and not even primarily contemplation which has become an entirely meaningless experience. Thought itself, when it became “reckoning with consequences,” became a function of the brain, with the result that electronic instruments are found to fulfill these functions much better than we ever could.”

“For mortals, the ‘easy life of the gods’ would be a lifeless life.” - Hannah Arendt, "The Human Condition“

Evil is never radical, it is only extreme, possessing neither depth nor any demonic dimension. It is ‘thought-defying’ because thought tries to reach some depth, to go to the roots, and the moment it concerns itself with evil, it is frustrated because there is nothing. That is its ‘banality.’ Only the good has depth that can be radical. - Hannah Arendt

Attention isn't free. It's the most valuable thing you spend.

Flashy gets attention. Boring gets results.
While most chase the views, the greats obsess over the basics.

Don't curse the obstacle; find a way around it.
Elite special forces don't complain about defenses—they adapt their tactics or create new ones. When a primary route is compromised, they don't waste time lamenting. They quickly shift to another approach. Elite athletes don't complain about defenses—they find the gap or create one.
Face the obstacle. Find the gap. Or make one.

It's true that determining the actual problem takes time, but it’s far quicker than solving the wrong one and starting over.

Smart people are uniquely vulnerable to mistaking complexity for insight.
An executive writes a ten-page memo that could be one. An engineer builds an intricate system when a simple one would perform better at half the cost. We attach prestige to what mystifies us. Complexity intoxicates both the creator and audience, drugging us with the illusion of wisdom. Mastery isn't making the simple complex—it's finding the elegant simplicity that cuts through the complexity.

You have just six seconds to capture someone’s attention - but if you interest them, you earn another twenty to thirty seconds. Practically, this means you have about thirteen words to hook them and another thirty to forty to deliver your most compelling information.

The Power of the Perfect Pause
The quietest person at a dinner party often leaves with a reputation for brilliance, while others talk themselves into corners.
You see it in boardrooms too - the executive who tilts her head thoughtfully during presentations, somehow radiating wisdom without speaking a word. Even therapists build their practices more on artful silences than clever words. The wisest among us have learned that saying nothing often says everything.

It can be hard to appreciate how much a little extra makes a big difference.
Making five extra calls a day may seem small, but do that for a month, and you'll have made 100 extra calls. Work an extra hour a day because you don't go out partying with your friends, and you've got 6 weeks of work in a year over your colleagues. Tha
When you consistently do more, the returns compound dramatically. Like superlinear growth curves, each extra bit of effort builds on previous overperformance. The key is that extra effort compounds - just as doing a bit less daily leads to compounding underperformance.

Crises, setbacks, obstacles—these will certainly be met by any executive in the course of his career. The measure of a person in such circumstances is not only how they cope with adversity, but also how they turns it to their advantage.

1. One man's constant is another man's variable.

3. Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.
====
4. Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.
====
5. If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.
====
6. Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere.
====
7. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

8. A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.
====
9. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.

10. Get into a rut early: Do the same process the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference(!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list - not the size of his vocabulary.

26. There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in all known languages can only be said poorly.
====
27. Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.
====
28. Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that would take as long?
====
29. For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, not just an additional node.

33. The eleventh commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.

34. The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.
====
35. Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught not to. So it is with great programmers.
====
36. The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.
====
37. The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory external emulator. The standarization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen.

49. Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.

53. So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.

54. Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.

55. A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

56. Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is arbitrarily changeable.

57. It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

58. Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

59. In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.

62. In computing, invariants are ephemeral.

63. When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't.
====
64. Often it is the means that justify the ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when goal structures crumble.

65. Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

"I'm an instant star. Just add water and stir." - David Bowie
====
If you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting. - David Bowie

"Failure will never stand in the way of success if you learn from it." - Hank Aaron
====
The most important lessons here - especially for young people - is that even if you’re shooting for the stars, you’re going to spend most of your time on a plateau. That’s where the deepest, most lasting learning takes place, so you might as well enjoy it. When I was first learning…I just assumed that I would steadily improve. My first plateau was something of a shock and disappointment, but I persevered and finally experienced an apparent spurt of learning. The next time my outward progress stopped, I said to myself ‘oh damn, another plateau’. After a few months, there was another spurt of progress and then, of course, the inevitable plateau. This time, something marvellous happened. I found myself thinking ‘Oh boy, another plateau. Good, if I stay on it and keep practicing, I’m absolutely assured another surge of progress. It was one of the best and warmest moments of my life.’ - George Leonard

Most people quit before they reach their best work.
Excellence lives in doing a bit more than others.

"Somebody once said we never know what is enough until we know what's more than enough." - Billie Holiday

“What I know for certain is that the conclusions I would draw from experience are different from the ones based only on figures. Because if Lionel Messi scores three times out of every ten attempts, he might be criticized by someone who sees only the statistics for being just 30 per cent effective. I’d say: just copy him and see if you can get up to that level. It’s practically impossible.” - Johan Cruyff
====
The meaning you give work determines its difficulty.
A coder working on a passion project works 12 hours straight and calls it energizing. That same programmer, doing maintenance on legacy code they consider meaningless, feels exhausted after 2 hours.
Your relationship with the work shapes its weight more than the work itself.

It can be hard to appreciate just how much reliability impacts opportunity. 
It's fun to outperform people who are way smarter than you by being more reliable than they are.

"Losing hope is not so bad. There's something worse: losing hope and hiding it from yourself." ― Walker Percy
====
We should not try to alter circumstances but to adapt ourselves to them as they really are, just as sailors do. They don't try to change the winds or the sea but ensure that they are always ready to adapt themselves to conditions. In a flat calm they use the oars; with a following breeze they hoist full sail; in a head wind they shorten sail or heave to. Adapt yourself to circumstances in the same way. - Bion of Borysthenes
====
Waiting for perfect conditions is how otherwise intelligent people keep themselves stuck.
Two entrepreneurs spot the same opportunity. One builds elaborate plans; the other tests crude prototypes. The planner is still planning when the tester sells their company.
While you wait for perfect conditions, others are creating them.

“Success is being excited to go to work and being excited to come home.” - Will Ahmed

If you want to get paid, find the contrast.
No one hears you if you sneeze in the middle of New York. But if you sneeze in a library, everyone does. The same concept applies to work.
It's better to dominate a small pond than drown in an ocean.

Everyone gets knocked down; the difference is who stays down.
When you’re on the ground, you’ll hear people saying, ‘That's not fair’ or ‘That shouldn't happen.’ The longer you lie there, the louder the voices become.
Getting up isn’t easy, but it’s the only way forward.

"When you hate, the only person that is suffering is you because most of the people you hate don’t know it and the rest don't care." - Medgar Evers
====
One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself; you will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself; the height of your success is gauged by your self-mastery, the depth of your failure by your self-abandonment. Those who cannot establish dominion over themselves will have no dominion over others.

"We must reach out our hand in friendship and dignity both to those who would befriend us and those who would be our enemy." - Arthur Ashe

To free us from the expectations of others, to give us back to ourselves—there lies the great, the singular power of self-respect. - Joan Didion
====
“I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.” - Joan Didion
====
The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short. - Arthur Schopenhauer
====
“You may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge and get it into your power.” - Arthur Schopenhauer

“In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.” - Eric Hoffer

“Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.” – Daniel Kahneman
====
Woozle Effect: “A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.” - Daniel Kahneman.
====
“No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” - Daniel Kahneman
====
1. Delay Your Intuition: Most people form an impression in seconds and spend the rest of their time confirming it. The best wait for all the information before letting their intuition speak. - Daniel Kahneman
====
2. Loss Aversion Creates Permanent Programs: Once you give people something (a perk, a feature, a benefit), it’s nearly impossible to take back. The founder who would offer free lunch on day one can’t cancel it on day 1000. Small groups lose something specific, while large groups gain something abstract. Every time. - Daniel Kahneman
====
3. Your Rules Become Your Default: Danny was human just like us; he often said yes to things he didn’t want to do. So he created a rule. Not a goal, not an intention, a rule. It reprogrammed his unconscious mind, turning his desired behavior into his default behavior. - Daniel Kahneman
====
4. Facts Don’t Form Beliefs: “I believe in climate change,” Kahneman said. “I believe in the people who tell me there is climate change. The people who don’t believe in climate change, they believe in other people.” This is how we form all beliefs. We don’t examine evidence and reach conclusions. We trust people we like, then adopt their views. “The reasons are not the causes of our beliefs,” he explained. They’re the stories we tell ourselves afterward. Want to change someone’s mind? Facts won’t do it. They need to trust you first. If they admire you, they’ll find reasons to agree. If they dislike you, the best evidence won’t matter. Smart people believe opposite things because they trust different people. - Daniel Kahneman
====
5. The Julia Fallacy: You have the following information. Julia is graduating college. She read fluently at age four. What’s her GPA? You just thought of something around 3.8, and Kahneman knew you would. Here’s why: a four-year-old who reads fluently seems exceptional, maybe 90th percentile. So your brain assumes 90th percentile everything. “It’s idiotic statistically,” he said. Early reading barely predicts college performance. Doesn’t matter. We can’t help ourselves. Stellar interview means stellar employee. One bad presentation means the person can’t teach. Our predictions match our impressions, even when they shouldn’t. - Daniel Kahneman
====
6. Winners Want the Score, Not the Prize: Why do billionaires work 80-hour weeks? “They’re clearly not doing this because they need more money,” Kahneman observed. At that level, money becomes proof that you’re good at what you do. His research found that past $70,000, extra money doesn’t make you emotionally happier, it just makes you more satisfied with your life. And these are completely different things. Happiness is social, it’s being with people who love you. Satisfaction is conventional success: money, prestige, achievements. The tragedy? “People don’t seem to care about how happy they’ll be. They want to be satisfied with their life.” We optimize for the story we’ll tell, not the life we’ll actually live. - Daniel Kahneman
====
7. Behavior Is Situation, Not Personality: When someone acts like a jerk, “look at the situation they’re in,” Kahneman advised. We instinctively blame personality. Psychologists call this the fundamental attribution error. When others speed, we think they’re reckless. When we speed, we know we’re late for something important. “People do good things for a mixture of good and bad reasons, and they do bad things for a mixture of good and bad reasons.” The kindest person will snap under enough pressure, and the worst person will help when the conditions are right. Change the environment, change the behavior. - Daniel Kahneman
====
8. Algorithms Beat You Every Time: “If you can replace judgements by rules and algorithms, they’ll do better,” Kahneman said. Not sometimes, always. We trust our judgment and value human insight, but we’re consistently wrong about this. The real problem is that we prefer confident, intuitive leaders to analytical ones. “People want leaders who are intuitive,” Kahneman observed. We choose the leaders who make us feel good about ourselves, not the ones who make good decisions. - Daniel Kahneman
====
9. Wherever There’s Judgment, There’s Noise: An insurance company asked Kahneman to test their underwriters. Same exact cases, same information, 50 different people. The executives expected maybe 10% variation in quotes. The reality shocked them: 50% variation. One customer gets quoted $10,000, another gets $15,000 for the exact same coverage. “Wherever there is judgment, there is noise, and more of it than you think,” he said. The solution is simple: use algorithms or structured procedures. But companies would rather live with expensive chaos than admit their experts disagree with each other. - Daniel Kahneman
====
10. Legitimize Doubt: Before making a big decision, Kahneman recommended this technique: gather your team and say, “It’s two years from now. We made this decision and it was a disaster. Write down what went wrong.” He loved this because timing is everything. “When people are coming close to a decision, it becomes difficult to raise doubts,” he explained. Anyone slowing things down becomes the enemy. The premortem flips this dynamic, it doesn’t just allow dissent, it requires it. It won’t prevent every mistake, but it forces you to face the problems everyone’s trying to ignore. - Daniel Kahneman
====
11. Clear Intuitions Fool Experts: Experts see all the options. You don’t. When economists design policies or product managers add features, they imagine users comparing every possibility. But you take a job and forget the others existed. You buy a house and stop thinking about the ones you passed on. Life isn’t a menu where you see all choices side by side, it’s one door closing as another opens. “They are completely lost between clear intuitions and strong intuitions,” Kahneman said. The expert thinks small differences matter because they can see them all. You can’t see them, so they don’t. That’s why economists botch predictions and why your phone has 50 features you’ve never touched. - Daniel Kahneman
====
Politicians do not win elections to make policies; they make policies to win elections. What’s most persuasive to voters isn’t whether an idea is right, but whether it narrates a story that confirms what they see and believe in the world.

“If you accept death, it is altogether like a frosty night and an anxious misgiving, but a frosty night in a vineyard full of sweet grapes. You will soon take pleasure in your wealth. Death ripens.

“I can't tell you how much time is spent worrying about decisions that don't matter. To just be able to make a decision and see what happens is tremendously empowering, but that means you have to set up the situation such that when something does go wrong, you can fix it. When something does go wrong, it doesn't cost you or your customer an exorbitant amount. It isn't ridiculously expensive. When you get in situations where you cannot afford to make a mistake, it's very hard to do the right thing. So if you're trying to do the right thing, the right thing might be to eliminate the cost of making a mistake rather than try to guess what's right.” - Ward Cunningham

In an age of information overload, the ability to read deeply and extract genuine understanding becomes increasingly rare and valuable. Many people can read basic text, but few know how to truly absorb and engage with challenging material in a way that transforms their understanding. - Mortimer J. Adler, Charles van Doren: "How to Read a Book"
====
1. Inspectional Reading: Learn to quickly evaluate a book's value before investing deep time. Systematically preview content to grasp the main structure and decide if fuller reading is warranted.
2. Analytical Reading: Engage in genuine conversation with the author. Identify core arguments, challenge assumptions, and connect ideas rather than just collecting facts.
3. Syntopical Reading: Master the art of reading multiple books on the same subject. Create a dialogue between different authors and develop your own well-reasoned position.

Il Fascismo conviene agli italiani perché è nella loro natura e racchiude le loro aspirazioni, esalta i loro odi, rassicura la loro inferiorità. Il fascismo è demagogico ma padronale, retorico, xenofobo, odiatore di cultura, spregiatore della libertà e della giustizia, oppressore dei deboli, servo dei forti, sempre pronto a indicare negli “altri” le cause della sua impotenza o sconfitta. Il fascismo è lirico, gerontofobo, teppista se occorre, stupido sempre, ma alacre, plagiatore, manierista. Non ama la natura, perché identifica la natura nella vita di campagna, cioè nella vita dei servi; ma è cafone, cioè ha le spocchie del servo arricchito. Odia gli animali, non ha senso dell’arte, non ama la solitudine, né rispetta il vicino, il quale d’altronde non rispetta lui. Non ama l’amore, ma il possesso. Non ha senso religioso, ma vede nella religione il baluardo per impedire agli altri l’ascesa al potere. Intimamente crede in Dio, ma come ente col quale ha stabilito un concordato, do ut des.
È superstizioso, vuole essere libero di fare quel che gli pare, specialmente se a danno o a fastidio degli altri.
Ennio Flaiano, Don't Forget, 1976
