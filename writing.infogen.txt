— old Hungarian saying
====
“You just got to put in the work. That’s all it is. If you watch enough Rocky movies – and there are six of them, three of them are really f— king good – anytime Rocky tried to take a shortcut in training, he got his ass whooped. And, you know, Rocky III, he’s in a nice gym and the girls are there kissing his muscles and all that bulls— t, and Mr. T beats the s— t out of him and then he has to go in the dirty gym with the black guys. There’s no shortcut.”

— Chris Rock
====
“Writing is essentially donkey work, manual labor of the mind. What makes it bearable are those moments (which sometimes can last for weeks, months) when the book takes over, takes on a life of its own, goes off in unexpected directions.”

— John Gregory Dunne
====
“There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error.”

—  William Faulkner

— Zadie Smith

— Bill Murray, The French Dispatch
====
“Keep typing until it turns into writing.”

— David Carr
====
“Tellers of stories with ink on paper, not that they matter anymore, have been either swoops or bashers. Swoopers write a story quickly, higgledy-piggledy, crinkum-crankum, any which way. Then they go over it again painstakingly, fixing everything that is just plain awful or doesn’t work. Bashers go one sentence at a time, getting it exactly right before they go on to the next one.”

— Kurt Vonnegut, Timequake
====

====
“I’m thinking of Leonard Nimoy’s spiritual journey from writing I Am Not Spock (1975) to writing I Am Spock (1995). This is a journey we all must make.”

— Tim Kreider
====
“The good writer seems to be writing about himself, but has his eye always on that thread of the universe, which runs through himself and all things.”

—  Ralph Waldo Emerson
====

“The things you do badly are as much part of your style as the things you do well.”

— Martin Scorsese

—  Simone Weil
====
“I try to be patient. I remember Colette, who wrote that her most essential art was ‘not that of writing, but the domestic task of knowing how to wait, to conceal, to save up crumbs, to reglue, regild, change the worst into the not-so-bad, how to lose and recover in the same moment that frivolous thing, a taste for life."”

— Dani Shapiro, Still Writing
====
“If I had one thing to say to artists, it would be to be patient. And to be ignorant of what you think you know. If you don’t get the answer that you were expecting, maybe that’s a good thing. Knowing what you’re doing is overrated.”

—  Pope.L
====
“You never reach a point of certainty, a point of mastery where you can say, Right. Now I understand how this is done. That is why so many talented people stop writing. It’s hard to tolerate this not-knowing.”

— Jenny Offill
====
“Each book has to teach you how to write it.”

— Salman Rushdie
====
“You have no right to assume that you'll be able to write because you could write yesterday. On the other hand, when there are dark times, you can say, I've faced this before. You learn that you will always have to mark time, that you shouldn't rush, that if you wait, the book will come to you. But you only build up this knowledge through long experience. Your daily work is very much about the line, the paragraph. It's not about the grand design of your career.”

— Hilary Mantel
====
“Dear Reader, forgive what you do not approve, & love me for this energetic exertion of my talent.”

— William Blake

====
“If you would be a poet, write living newspapers. Be a reporter from outer space, filing dispatches to some supreme managing editor who believes in full disclosure and has a low tolerance for bullshit.”

— Lawrence Ferlinghetti
====
“Lack of verifiable context is what makes writing normally so much more agonizing an activity than oral presentation to a real audience. The writer’s audience is always a fiction.”

— William Ong, Orality and Literary

====
“Everything here is so mixed up, nothing’s connected any more, and sometimes I very much doubt whether anyone in the future will be interested in all my tosh.”

— Anne Frank
====
"The impulse is always, what do you feel most confused about and most unsure about. You can assume that others like you are having similar doubts. As I've always said, your job is to preach to the converted. That's what preachers are supposed to talk about. It's not the things we know are true, but the things were worried might not be true, that contravene our faith. That's the place to go. Anything good comes from a place of unknowing.”

— Tony Kushner
====

====
“One of my former husbands remarked that when I had a good day writing, I looked like a Catholic who had seen the pope.”

— Louise Glück
====
“It is surprising how much one can produce in a year, whether of buns or books or pots or pictures, if one works hard and professionally for three and a half hours every day for 330 days. That was why, despite her disabilities, Virginia was able to produce so very much."

— Leonard Woolf
